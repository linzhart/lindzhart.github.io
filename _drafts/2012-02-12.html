Valentine's card from my oldest<br /><br />Dear Mom,<br />I love you very much and with all my heart. &nbsp;I also love Daddy because I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I heard him say to have some clothes for school and in the morning he said if we got ready for school he would show us a movie.<br /><br />From: Ian<br />To: Mom and Dad.
