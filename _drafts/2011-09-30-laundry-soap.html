I feel like I talk about laundry a lot around here.  Maybe this should be a laundry blog.  But a laundry FAIL blog, where you can go to get tips about how to stink at laundry (leave it in the washer overnight - ha).  A blog for those people who are so perfect they need to pretend to be bad at stuff so that people will like them.  <div><br /></div><div>It is mostly my job to do the laundry, since I am home the most.  But Husband helps out too.  Because of this I try to keep him informed about what is going on in the laundry sector of my life.  </div><div><br /></div><div>conversation:</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm thinking of making laundry soap again.  I didn't like the way the last batch turned out but it is so much cheaper. . . . "</div><div><br /></div><div>two weeks later:  "I've been trying to get to the store for laundry soap ingredients. . . "</div><div><br /></div><div>two weeks later laundry soap ingredients sitting on the kitchen counter in a grocery sack.  The sack is removed and they sit for another week.</div><div><br /></div><div>The bar soap is grated and stored in an old soap container.  It joins the other ingredients on the counter.</div><div><br /></div><div>A week later: "I found a new recipe for laundry soap that I'm going to try, but it calls for so much water I don't have a bucket big enough to mix it in.  I'm thinking I'll borrow one from my mom."</div><div><br /></div><div>A week later the bucket shows up outside our back door where it sits for several days.</div><div><br /></div><div>I finally get around to making the soap.  The whole house smells like soap and the five-gallon-bucket sits on the counter for another four days.  Me:  "I don't have a funnel"</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
