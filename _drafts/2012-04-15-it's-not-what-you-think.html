<i>Please don't ever&nbsp;eavesdrop&nbsp;at our house. &nbsp;You'd feel obligated to call Child and Family Services.</i><br /><br />While I was changing Lil' girl's diaper the other month she was talking. &nbsp;She is always talking. &nbsp;And I was tuning her out a tiny bit, and just responding on auto pilot with "Yes. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;Mmm-hmm, it's very nice."<br /><br />And then I realized that she had been asking, "Is this my vagina?"<br /><br />She walked around all afternoon saying "I have a very nice vagina. &nbsp;I have a very nice vagina."<br /><br />She decided that every dark spot on anyone's skin is called a nipple. &nbsp;And she is&nbsp;fascinated&nbsp;by the moles and freckles on my arms.<br /><br />Her: "Mom, I'm pinching your nipple."<br />Me: "That's a mole."<br />Her: "No. &nbsp;It is a nipple and I'm pinching it."<br />Me: "No you're not! It is a mole."<br /><br />She likes to watch Backyardigans (which is one of the least annoying children's shows available, by the way). &nbsp;One episode features a character playing an evil-villain&nbsp;named the "Lady in Pink." &nbsp;Naturally, this appealed to Lil'. &nbsp;So she was pretending to be the Lady in Pink and all of the toys she was playing with were her Lady Things. &nbsp;Somehow during&nbsp;snack-time&nbsp;"things" became "parts." &nbsp;So when her brothers got up from the table before her she yelled at them: "DON'T TOUCH MY LADY PARTS!"<br /><br />They had no idea what she was talking about and ran around the room touching everything and giggling. &nbsp;"Is it the couch? The books? The rocking chair?" &nbsp;While she followed after them screaming: "DON'T TOUCH MY LADY PARTS!"<br /><br />I went upstairs and hid in my bedroom.
