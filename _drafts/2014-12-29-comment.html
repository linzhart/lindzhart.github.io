I've been thinking a lot about setting goals lately. I love goals and getting things done and to-do lists, but I also hate them. Once upon another life I was an a Project Manager for the Administrative Team of a medium-sized business in a big city. Which basically means that I kept an entire branch of the office organized. I loved it and I was good at it.<br /><br />Now I am Stay At Home Momma to five little darlings and very little of what I learned at work translates directly to getting things done at home. The same principles apply, but it is complicated and frustrating to figure out exactly how it works.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://eagle.northwestu.edu/departments/wellness-center/files/2013/03/calvin-hobbes-new-years-resolutions.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://eagle.northwestu.edu/departments/wellness-center/files/2013/03/calvin-hobbes-new-years-resolutions.jpg" height="241" width="320" /></a></div>You've probably heard the advice that you should set only a few small, specific goals and not do anything else until they are done. Well, my only goal in life for two weeks straight was to get the kitchen floor swept and mopped. Some days I was awake for roughly 18 hours straight and still never managed to complete a simple 30 minute task.<br /><br />I spent a long time feeling terrible about myself until I figured out that my problem was not that I was incapable of getting simple things done, but that I hadn't actually written down all my goals. I thought I knew what I was trying to accomplish, but my focus was on specific tasks and not the overarching priorities. So instead of thinking that all I wanted to get done was keep my feet from sticking to the kitchen floor, I needed to realize that my first goal was to take care of the physical needs of seven people. Add in their emotional, spiritual and mental needs and suddenly not being able to carve out half an hour of time where no-one needs either me or the kitchen makes a whole lot more sense.<br /><br />Now to make a list of priorities instead of goals. Somehow this is easier for me to wrap my head around than a to-do list. And I feel a lot better about myself. So every couple of months I go back and read over what my priorities are and think about how I can work towards them in my day, and Husband and I work on family priorities (Eventually, I'd like to get the children in on it, too.)<br /><br />
