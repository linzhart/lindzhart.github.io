<div style="text-align: center;"><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#0000ee"><u><br /></u></font></div>A while back I stumbled upon the blog of a woman I sort-of know.  I've seen her around and we have some mutual friends.  She seemed nice; kids, husband, trendy clothes that manage to look fashionable and down-to-earth at the same time.  Then I saw her blog.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div>It was PROFESSIONAL.  Like, she makes money writing about making jam with her three-year-old and buying all organic vegetables at happy family outings to the farmer's market.  </div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div>I'm ashamed, but my first thought was: "I'll bet she isn't as good a mother as me.  She probably had to ignore her kids for hours to sew those matching dresses for herself and her daughter."</div><div><br /></div><div>And my second thought was:  "Why don't I ever make jam?  My kids are missing out on so many life experiences.  I'm an awful mother."</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div>I hate it when my faults gang up on me like that.  Fortunately, my third thought was: "Good for her.  I'll have to come back here for cute craft tips when I have time."</div><div><br /></div><div>The nice thing about the internet is that you can stop yourself from broadcasting the first thing that pops into your head.  (Or the second) and give yourself some time to sort through your emotions.  Especially if you happen to have emotional reactions to other people's accomplishments.</div><div style="text-align: center; "></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div>And speaking of accomplishements. . . . . . TA-DA!  </div><br /><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mjh4y-AXdW0/ToaBjXGN6zI/AAAAAAAAAoY/oL8ojhpMjvA/s400/IMGP2580.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5658352426333104946" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px; "><div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left; ">Look really closely, because I did have to ignore my children to finish. . . . making JAM.</div><div><br /></div></div><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--UIwmsalKKs/ToaBjmMI9fI/AAAAAAAAAog/_M5pazRdE0A/s400/IMGP2581.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5658352430384477682" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px; "><div>It doesn't taste that great.  And we only got two small jars because they ate most of the strawberries before I got to them.  But hey, I made jam.  I've never done that before.  And now I know what not to do if I decide to try again.  </div></div><div><br /></div><div>So thanks, Marie (No, I'm not going to tell you her real name.  What if she found my blog and knew this was about her?  I'd die of embarrassment.)  Thanks for inspiring me to try something new.  Please forgive my knee-jerk reactions to your wonderful life.  </div>
