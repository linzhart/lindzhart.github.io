Almost without realizing it, I've been waiting for this day ever since I had a child.<br /><br />And when he was one, I rocked him to sleep, and cried to think of Lily Potter, having to leave her son to be raised by people who did not love him.<br /><br />And when everyone in his class was reading Harry Potter I told him he couldn't, because I thought it was too scary. But I realized I was just afraid he wouldn't love it as much as I do.<br /><br />So I decided to trust in the magic of the story, and I gave him the first book. And my eyes filled with tears as he heard the words, "You're a wizard, Harry." for the first time.<br /><br />And I was both happy and sad when he begged me to stop reading it aloud to him, because he couldn't bear to wait for me while I made dinner and put his baby sisters to bed.<br /><br />And I was both happy and exasperated when he hid the books in the bathroom, so that he could read them past bedtime without me knowing.<br /><br />And so he read all the books again and again, just as I have. (and still do)<br /><br />And we had wonderful discussions about magic, and favorite characters, and movie marathons.<br /><br />And sometimes I hid the books from him and forced him to go outside. And sometimes we just read together outside.<br /><br />And there were so many days when I worried about how I would pay for his lunch or school clothes, and I was sure that I would never be able to afford this.<br /><br />And yesterday he turned 11.<br /><br />And tomorrow we board the Hogworts Express!
