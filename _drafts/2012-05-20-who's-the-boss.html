Several weeks ago I was listening to my husband and my brother-in-law talk about childbirth. &nbsp;Specifically, their preferences in medical care. <br /><br />It was pretty interesting to hear their perspectives on the subject, and they've both had some bad&nbsp;experiences with doctors and nurses at the births of their children. &nbsp;So they have some&nbsp;definite&nbsp;opinions on the subject.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Example from the birth of our second child: &nbsp;The nurse was a little flustered and having trouble getting my IV set up. &nbsp;She says to the other nurse, "Is that in? &nbsp;I can't tell." Answer: &nbsp;"Just start it and see. . . " I've rarely seen him that mad. &nbsp;I think he might have hit someone had I not been on the bed between them. &nbsp;</blockquote><br />Mostly they were discussing how frustrating it is to try and get information from a doctor or nurse sometimes. &nbsp;And they are both very interested in knowing all the details of what is going on.<br /><br />I thought it was kind of fun to listen to. &nbsp;And then I started thinking about all the people who think that as men, they should have no opinion at all on the matter. &nbsp;I know my husband isn't the one with a small person growing inside him, and he won't be the one in pain come labor day - but it is his kid and his wife. &nbsp;If ever he was entitled to an opinion, now is the time. &nbsp;He should have a say in things like where we deliver the baby and what kind of care we&nbsp;receive. <br /><br />I find it interesting that many women are so&nbsp;adamant&nbsp;that a man can never say anything about what SHE does with HER body, and yet are carrying THEIR child inside that body. &nbsp;Ownership of a body is&nbsp;fascinating. &nbsp;Who does it belong to? &nbsp;I'm fortunate that my husband and I have such a good relationship and can communicate so well. &nbsp;We don't ever really have to define that. &nbsp;Because I think it can be kind of a grey area. There may not be a "right" answer. <br /><br />When we were expecting our first, we had some neighbors who were also expecting their first. &nbsp;We were discussing babies and she asked if we thought we were having a girl or a boy. &nbsp;I answered that we hadn't had the ultrasound yet, but that John had a pretty strong feeling that it was a boy. &nbsp;I was shocked at her response: "HE'S not the mother! &nbsp;He doesn't have any kind of special connection with the baby! &nbsp;How could HE say he thinks it's a boy?"<br /><br />How sad that men are not "allowed" to have a special connection with their children before they are born. &nbsp;Then we emphasize the "mother-child bond" so much that lots of fathers feel they shouldn't try and bond with their new baby, because they don't want to get in the way. &nbsp;And then you hear mothers complaining that their husbands don't help and don't know how to take over as full parenting partners.
