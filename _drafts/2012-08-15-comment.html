So now that we are two months out I feel ready to talk more about Baby #5's birth. &nbsp;It went very smoothly, no complications at all. &nbsp;The hospital staff was great. &nbsp;The older children were well taken care of, and I got to come home with a beautiful baby. (The end. &nbsp;You can move on now if any more detail is scary to you.)<br /><br />This is the first baby I've delivered with no medication at all, which I wanted to do more because I hate being numb and unable to move around and less for the "naturalness" of it.<br /><br />Let me first say that I don't feel partcularly empowered by this. &nbsp;I've read some childbirth books that recomend going without medication so that you could feel like a powerful, strong woman. &nbsp;I AM a strong, powerful woman. No amount of baby pushing is going to change that one way or another. &nbsp;So, yes. &nbsp;I can deliver a baby with no pain medication. &nbsp;I can also deliver a baby with pain medication.<br /><br />I'd been taking some herbs that are supposed to help with childbirth (sporadically, because keeping food down and remembering things are not my forte while pregnant). &nbsp;Mostly raspberry tea which I hate, but I crave it. &nbsp;I think it helped, but I can't go back and do it differently to get you a more scientific data sample. &nbsp;My understanding of the herbs is that they work by toning your muscles ahead of time, to make the labor itself easier.<br /><br /><br />
