I've been writing and re-writing a post about my darling seven year old and it just isn't working. &nbsp;Maybe I'll get back to it. &nbsp;For now, here are some of the conversations I've had with him over the past couple of weeks.<br /><br />Him: &nbsp;"It isn't FAIR that I have homework and Lil' girl doesn't."<br />Me: "She's two. &nbsp;You didn't have homework when you were two."<br />Him: "So. &nbsp;It still isn't fair."<br />Me: "Well, you're just going to have to get over that."<br />Him: "Well, you're going to have to get over SAYING that."<br /><br />Him: "She lost my marker lid!"<br />Me: "I'm sure it's around here somewhere."<br />Him: "It is NOT. &nbsp;Now the marker won't color, and I'll never be able to use this marker AGAIN!"<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(and now he's crying)<br />Him: "If I you don't find my marker lid I am going to be mad at YOU!"<br />Me: "That's fine."<br />Him: "Because its your fault!"<br />Me: "No its not. &nbsp;But if you feel like being mad go ahead."<br /><br />Him: "It's not FAIR."<br />Me: "Nope."<br /><br />Him: "I am not doing my homework unless you get me something to eat!"<br />Me: "I'm making dinner. &nbsp;You can eat a soon as its ready."<br />Him: "Well, I'm not going to do my homework."<br />Me: "That's your choice. &nbsp;It isn't my job to do your homework. &nbsp;But the rule is you can't play until it is done."<br />Him: "I need a bigger snack! &nbsp;Why can't we have TWO lunches?"<br />Me: "Because I already made you a lunch today, now I'm making you dinner."<br />Him: "Well, I'm not doing my homework."<br />Me: "That's fine. &nbsp;You can tell your teacher why you didn't get it done."<br /><br />There are also a whole vocabulary of grunts and humphs and eye rolls and foot stomps to let me know his displeasure.<br /><br />It is perfectly normal and healthy. &nbsp;Everything is fine. &nbsp;He's seven. &nbsp;This is what seven-year-olds do. &nbsp;I'm trying to be all zen about the whole thing. &nbsp;I'm getting better.<br /><br />Seven has also brought a whole new level of sweetness in the form of letters and notes and pictures that all say "I love you, Mom." <br /><br />The anger is the hardest for me to handle, but also the best thing going on with him right now. &nbsp;I'll try not to lecture you too much on child-development. &nbsp;He is getting a lot more control over his emotions, and is able to distract himself from things that are distressing. &nbsp;So the talking back, foot stomping, ect, are actually replacement behaviors for crying and whining; giving him a little distance and control over the situation. &nbsp;It's good. &nbsp;It's also annoying.<br /><br />The more I pray about what to do, the more the answers come that I shouldn't do anything. &nbsp;I shouldn't lecture, shouldn't remind. &nbsp;HE KNOWS. &nbsp;I just need to let him figure it out. &nbsp;Do you know how hard that is? &nbsp;Inaction is not a parenting skill of mine. &nbsp;But he has been taught right from wrong, and I just need to let the natural consequences take their course. &nbsp;(Most of the time.)<br /><br />Also, most of my discipline stratagies have been phazed out now. &nbsp;You don't really send a seven-year-old to "time out." &nbsp;I occasionally sent him to his room, but that is more so that both of us can cool off. &nbsp;See, he usually has candy in his pockets and a book in his bed - so sending him to his room is not really a punishment. &nbsp;I do threaten to take away privelages. &nbsp;But he is most attached to his books, and it is hard for me to want to take those away from him. &nbsp;"You can't read!" kind of runs counter to our entire parenting philosophy. &nbsp; Again, natural consequences. &nbsp;You don't clean up your toys = mom cleans up your toys and you can't find them (no wonder they check the garbage). &nbsp;And I really can't punish him for attitude. &nbsp;As annoying as I find it, annoying isn't a punishable offense at our house. &nbsp;Danger and destruction are pretty much the only things that are. &nbsp;It's a good thing too - I would be sent to time out regularly based solely on the music I like that no-one else does. <br /><br />So I'm doing what I always do. &nbsp;I pray. &nbsp;A lot. &nbsp;I highly recomend praying no matter what your religious affiliation is. &nbsp;Especially as a parent. &nbsp;And I mean more than meditating. &nbsp;It really helps me to talk through everything I'm thinking with God (he never repeats what I say to anyone). &nbsp;After I've explained everything that I'm feeling I'm able to formulate specific questions about what is going on. &nbsp;Most of the time I already have the answers. &nbsp;Once I boil down my issues to a specific question, I know how to begin my search for answers. &nbsp;Most of the time all I need from God is the peace to keep going. &nbsp;And that He has in abundance.
