My sister-in-law and her adorable 10-month-old were visiting the other day, and my four-year-old came up and snuggled on my lap. After listening to our conversation for a few minutes she interrupted us to have the following conversation.<br /><br />Child #3: "The baby has a penis."<br /><br />Me: "Yes. Yes he does."<br /><br />Child #3: "My brothers have penises too."<br /><br />Me: "They do. That is what makes them boys."<br /><br />Child #3: "Hmmmm...... My daddy has a big, big, big, big, big, ENORMOUS penis."<br /><br /><br />
