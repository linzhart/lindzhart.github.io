So here is a sad truth. I haven't felt in control of my life in years. Probably since before my third pregnancy. Certainly not since I got pregnant the fifth time (baby number four) and was thrown unceremoniously into this swirling vortex of chaos which is my life now. Oh, there have been hours, days even, when I didn't feel like I was underwater - but something always came up to throw everything off again.<br /><br />(Jim Gaffigan quote)<br /><br />And now.....lovely now. Have I told you how awesome this whole "not-pregnant" thing is? And also the sleeping through the night at least 3 nights a week? And I've cut way, WAY back on my church volunteer hours (bliss).<br /><br />This is how nice things are right now: my husband has actually admitted how hard the last few years were on him. He is a saint, and never complained. But I know it was rough on him. Also, and this is such a big deal that it needs it's own paragraph:<br /><br />I did the dishes four times in a row last week. FOUR TIMES.<br /><br />We have a dishwasher, so this isn't a big miracle. Except that it is. I haven't done the dishes for almost four years. We don't have any kind of chore system - whomever has time is the one who does the work. And recently I've had the time. It's pretty amazing.<br /><br />So here are a couple of things I've been thinking about as someone who actually gets the basic housekeeping things done on an almost-regular basis.<br /><br />#1 - Having a clean house isn't nearly as fulfilling as I thought it would be. I had always hoped that if the house was clean I would automatically feel better and get more done and be a better mother because I didn't have all those chores hanging over my head (or pasta stuck to my feet). Not so much. Turns out, I feel about the same as before. What do you know? My self worth wasn't hiding under the couch and it doesn't come shining out my windows just because they are clean. HA! I don't actually do windows. But it doesn't shine out of the vacuumed carpet either. And that I do get done.<br /><br />#2 - I think part of me was afraid to try my hardest in case I either a) failed or b) didn't fail. What if I really am capable of doing all the things on my to do list? What if I finish it and I have nothing to do and I find my life really has no meaning? Or, what if even if I try my hardest I can't do it? Which is worse? Well guess what? I am never going to run out of things to do, but I will be able to get to some of the things I are not essential to life. And I'm learning not to be intimidated by myself.<br /><br />#3 - (And this is what I really wanted to say) To those of you just a step or two behind me chronologically: Hang in there. There is a light at the end of the creepy Willy Wanka tunnel that is parenting small children. Don't feel pressured to enjoy it all the time. Though well-meaning old folks might tell you to. You don't have to smile fondly at every snot-covered, screaming,<br /><br />
