Let me tell you a little story about my entryway closet. I am a big believer in the importance of comings and goings. Specifically, the attitude and feeling that one has when one leaves from and comes to one's own home. It makes a difference to how the whole day goes. And for us, leaving or coming home is a big production. Seven people's shoes, socks, coats, books, homework, gloves, hats, purse, keys, diapers, etc, etc, etc. all have to end up somewhere. So there tends to be a lot of chaos when we enter or exit. Everything is better when there is some organization to the whole endeavor. Kids can do most of the work themselves, and I don't have to yell at someone to put their shoes on (FOR THE FOURTH TIME!) It is hard, but it is important to me, so I've spent a lot of time making sure that our entryway space is neat and organized. It is made more difficult by the fact that we are fitting seven people into a small-ish space with very little closet space to begin with. But I've found some things that work, and it makes our mornings especially much less stressful.<br /><br />Also, my front closet is a space that I have almost complete control over. And once I found a system that worked, it required very little maintenance on my part. It was my beacon of hope in some of my darkest days. When I was pregnant and exhausted and children were screaming at me from all sides and the house was a disaster and we were eating scrambled eggs for dinner again, I could remember my front closet. It reminded me that not everything in my life was falling apart and that sometimes I do something right. Something that isn't undone five seconds later. So I clung to that one right thing, the one thing that helped me believe that someday I might feel human enough to organize a closet again.<br /><br />And now, NOW. I am that person again. Not everyday, but at least half the time. And just in time too, because I needed to rearrange that closet to accommodate another school-goer this year, and another person who can walk, and therefore needs shoes. So I thought and thought about how I might make everything work, how we could keep track of stuff and I found the perfect solution. It was beautiful, it was amazing and bonus! it didn't require me to buy anything new. And I got to get rid of a chair and a lamp that I didn't really like anyway (I am also a big believer in getting rid of "stuff").<br /><br />I was so proud of myself. I even took pictures so that I could blog about it. It took me the better part of two weeks, and we had to live in a living room that the closet regurgitated on - but it was all worth it to see my end result. (The only hitch, which I ashamedly admit here, is that I accidentally threw away one of my brand new shoes that got moved to the 'discard' pile by a helpful child. That was sad.)<br /><br />Every child had his or her own box for footwear and the boxes slid under a bench big enough for them all to sit on while putting on shoes. And we lived with the new order for two months, and it was bliss. Everything had a place. I loved to spend time in the living room.<br /><br />And then.... (cue the crescendo)<br /><br />Some friends were moving and offered us their piano. A PIANO.<br /><br />I have wanted a piano for years. I play a little, and it is one of my most treasured goals to play well. And my oldest two started piano lessons this year in school (their school has an awesome music program, and they get to stay after and have a second piano lesson once a week as well). So, yes. I wanted that piano. Come hell or high water I would find a place for it
