<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8IMNjev8JDw/Tydv1GSi-5I/AAAAAAAAAuA/8uLKuzguV_w/s1600/G+and+Evie.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8IMNjev8JDw/Tydv1GSi-5I/AAAAAAAAAuA/8uLKuzguV_w/s200/G+and+Evie.JPG" width="200" /></a></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven is a complicated age. &nbsp;It's difficult. &nbsp;And lately, my darling oldest has been a little on the difficult side - which is unusual for him. &nbsp;So here are some of the things I've been repeating in my head - kind of as a mantra - to remind myself to calm down and let it go.<br /><br />Most cultures have some kind of coming-of-age ceremony around the 7-8-9 ages. &nbsp;Kids are given more responsibility and privelages. &nbsp;As I watch my son, I can really see why. &nbsp;His whole way of thinking is changing. <br /><br />Middle childhood is when he starts to develop empathy. &nbsp;Actually being able to put himself in someone else's place and understand how they might feel. &nbsp;Empathy is HUGE. &nbsp;He is able to be kind to someone just because he knows it will make them feel good. &nbsp;He knows not to hurt someone - not because he will get into trouble - but because he knows what it is like to hurt. &nbsp;Also, he can hurt and manipulate intentionally.<br /><br />Because of this empathy, his friendships are on a whole new level. &nbsp;And I totally can't keep up. &nbsp;The alliances and sagas - it is worse than a soap opera.<br /><br />Also with the empathy comes the ability to play complicated games. &nbsp;Sports where each person plays a different position are impossible for a younger child to organize. They can play with adult supervision, but middle childhood kids can put them together all by themselves. &nbsp;They can cooperate on a whole new level because they are able to imagine how another player is seeing the game. &nbsp;Great for&nbsp;independence, but the complicated friendships only make this more complicated.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pU0qDE7FIcY/Tydwx8O_5rI/AAAAAAAAAug/2fWk40yeExk/s1600/justice-statue-18-inch-YT-7746.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pU0qDE7FIcY/Tydwx8O_5rI/AAAAAAAAAug/2fWk40yeExk/s200/justice-statue-18-inch-YT-7746.jpg" width="105" /></a>His empathy means that now he can lie. &nbsp;Of course, he has been able to say things that aren't true since he could talk, but intentionally lying is different. &nbsp;Lying is actually pretty sophisticated, you have to be able to understand the other person's point of view and what you can say to make them believe what you want them to. &nbsp;Younger kids lie, but they are mostly just saying what they wish was true in the face of their parent's anger - their understanding of reality and&nbsp;fantasy&nbsp;is sketchy. &nbsp;The earlier kids start lying is actually a good indicator of overall IQ. &nbsp;So congratulations for that.<br /><br />He also has a serious fixation with justice. &nbsp;Everything has to be fair. &nbsp;And by fair, he means equal. &nbsp;EXACTLY equal. &nbsp;Which means we have lovely conversations like "Why doesn't my two-year-old sister have homework?" and even when I&nbsp;explained&nbsp;that he didn't have homework when he was two, it still isn't fair, because no-one had to watch him color princesses and then do their homework. &nbsp;I reminded him of the fact that Daddy has been in school his WHOLE life. &nbsp;Somehow that didn't stave off the stomping out of the room to pout before finishing his math. <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mY_vo9qv3EM/TydwAnk_yBI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/2n0LAPg7YJU/s1600/slTemple_c10_CU040122.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mY_vo9qv3EM/TydwAnk_yBI/AAAAAAAAAuQ/2n0LAPg7YJU/s1600/slTemple_c10_CU040122.jpg" /></a>We're<a href="http://www.lds.org/?lang=eng"> Latter-Day Saints</a>, which means that if he chooses, he can be baptized after he turns eight. &nbsp;We believe that at eight a child can be accountable for his own actions - before this any misbehavior or sin were the direct responsibility of the parent (which is scary actually). &nbsp;But at eight, he can make his first covenant with God, and begin to decide what kind of person he wants to be for the rest of his life. &nbsp;We also believe that any child who dies before eight immediatly goes to heaven, after that, they will be judged on their choices. &nbsp;But again, the parents are responsible to teach them how to make good choices, and we will be accountable before God for how we taught (and showed good examples to) our children. &nbsp;So no pressure. &nbsp;Also, before eight, Satan is not allowed to tempt a child - all misbehavior is a result of the examples children have seen. &nbsp;After eight, they can start coming up with ideas on their own. <br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XgzjSry6E6c/TydwAdrkcvI/AAAAAAAAAuI/CSeMQOn8MYk/s1600/595154-jiminy1_super.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XgzjSry6E6c/TydwAdrkcvI/AAAAAAAAAuI/CSeMQOn8MYk/s200/595154-jiminy1_super.jpg" width="166" /></a><br />As part of his baptism, he will also recieve a special blessing, the option of the constant guide of the Holy Ghost to help him make good choices. &nbsp;Every human being has the Holy Ghost to guide them - we usually call it a conscience. &nbsp;But it comes and goes, and bothers us less the more we ignore it. &nbsp;But with the "Gift of the Holy Ghost" you can be guided through ALL your choices in life. &nbsp;Which is cool, when you are willing to always do what is right, which is hard. <br /><br />Whew! &nbsp;We're done with Sunday School (for now). &nbsp;So I'm reminding myself of this as I watch him ignore me and start making decisions simply because HE wants to and not because I tell him to. &nbsp;(Gee, I wonder where he sees that.) &nbsp;Now is a good time for him to want to be independant and I need to respect that, even when it is annoying or makes my life more complicated.<br /><br /><br />
