(Sorry, <a href="http://soulcolor.wordpress.com/">Sis</a>.  It was hilarious)<br /><div><br /></div><div>My brother-in-law and his wife graciously agreed to watch the children for us this week, since John and I had conflicting church assignments.  </div><div><br /></div><div>The baby is VERY attached to being constantly held by me, boy 1 was anticipating school starting the next day, boy 2 was running a fever and has developed a fear of monsters, and lil' girl, well, she's two.  It happens.</div><div><br /></div><div>When I returned home it was to find both of them a little wide eyed and ready to run out the door.  "We decided we don't want kids now."  They told me.  </div><div><br /></div><div>"You're welcome."  I said.  </div><div><br /></div><div>"No, really."  they said.  "The kids were really hard.  They fought with each other and cried because they were hungry and made the baby cry even more."</div><div><br /></div><div>I tried to be sympathetic, I think the snickers kind of ruined it though.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Welcome to my world.  The difference is no-one is going to come and rescue me.  I keep waiting for that responsible adult to show up and take over.  It hasn't happened yet.  </div>
