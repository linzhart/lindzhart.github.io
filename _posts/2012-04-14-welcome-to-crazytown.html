I feel like having five kids has put us over the edge, squarely in the "insane" category, according to most of our neighbors. &nbsp;It probably has more to do with where we live than anything else. &nbsp;The houses in our neighborhood are pretty small, so most people who live here move away when they start having kids, or don't plan on having many/any, or they are old and have lost the ability to filter their comments. <br /><br />Two kids was OK, three was acceptable (but only because the first two were boys, and we must have needed a girl), four was pushing it, but people seemed willing to make allowances for a surprise before we&nbsp;permanently&nbsp;took care of <i>our problem</i> or for us being really&nbsp;eccentric&nbsp;and actually liking children. &nbsp;Five? &nbsp;Now that is just plain crazy. &nbsp;You don't <i>accidentally </i>have five children. &nbsp;You must have lost your mind.<br /><br />This is mostly based on reactions from strangers or&nbsp;acquaintances, not people I'm actually close to. &nbsp;My family and friends are very supportive (or very good at hiding their true feelings).<br /><br />But I had this hilarious (I thought) conversation at the&nbsp;elementary&nbsp;school the other day as I watched the girls play on the steps waiting for the bell to ring. &nbsp;The other mom was one I recognized, she has a son in the same class as my oldest. <br /><br />Her: "Oh! I didn't realize you had TWO little ones. &nbsp;I've only seen the one."<br />Me: "Yup."<br />Her: "Wow. &nbsp;How close are they?"<br />Me: "That one is two, this one is one-and-a-half, and one on the way." I gesture to my obvious belly.<br />Her: "Oh, wow! &nbsp;So you'll have four? &nbsp;I can't even imagine."<br />Me: "Actually. . . five. &nbsp;I have one in Kindergarten."<br />Her: "Oh. . . . five. . . I have my hands full with my two. &nbsp;You must be SO busy."<br />Me: "They're not bad. &nbsp;The older ones help a lot."<br /><br />The expressions on her face every time she realized I had one more child than she'd thought were priceless. <br /><br />So, yes. &nbsp;I guess we seem a little crazy to a lot of people. &nbsp;It's OK. &nbsp;We aren't really having children to please anyone else. &nbsp;So go ahead and stare at us as we parade down the street. &nbsp;I'll pretend it is because you think my children are the most adorable thing you've ever seen, just like I do.
