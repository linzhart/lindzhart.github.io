<i>Just in case you don't have a dramatic two-year-old girl around your house to listen to.</i><br /><br />Daddy offered to let Lil' girl watch a movie on his iPad. &nbsp;You need to hear the outraged tone of voice to get the whole effect. &nbsp;Imagine a very upset two-year-old.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CUGjbJMIZHo/T4uBwp76uUI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/MmbHicXqhLQ/s1600/Lily.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CUGjbJMIZHo/T4uBwp76uUI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/MmbHicXqhLQ/s400/Lily.jpg" width="230" /></a><br />Her: "No, Daddy! &nbsp;That makes me SO MAD!"<br />Him: "What? &nbsp;Why?"<br />Her: "Because it is SO DANGEROUS!"<br />Him: "Why?"<br />Her: "Because I can't watch movies on your toy!"<br />Him: "Why?"<br />Her: "Because it makes me MAD."<br />Him: "Why does it make you mad?"<br />Her: "Because it is SO DANGEROUS!"<br />Him: "Why is it dangerous?"<br />Her: "Because it makes me SO MAD!"<br />Him: "But why does it make you mad?"<br />Her: "Because it is SO DANGEROUS!"<br />Him: "Oh no! You are caught in a tautological&nbsp;argument! How are you going to get out?"<br />Her: "That is SO DANGEROUS! And I am so MAD!"<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I handed her a stack of plates and asked her to spread them on the table. &nbsp;But I didn't count, so she had a few leftover.<br /><br />Her: "Mom, these ones are for the NOT yucky dinner. &nbsp;We can put fruit snacks on them."<br /><br />
