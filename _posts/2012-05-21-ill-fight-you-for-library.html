Maybe it will sound charming, like this passage from Inkheart, by Cornelia Funke: (even a mess sounds better when you read about it in a book)<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Meggie tugged him along the corridor so impatiently that he stubbed his toe on a pile of books, which was hardly surprising. &nbsp;Stacks of books were piled high all over the house- not just arranged in neat rows on bookshelves, the way other people kept them, oh no! The books in Mo and Meggie's house were stacked under tables, on chairs, in the corners of rooms. &nbsp;There were books in the kitchen and books in the lavatory. &nbsp;Books on the TV set and in the closet, small piles of books, tall piles of books, books thick and thin, books old and new. &nbsp;They welcomed Meggie down to breakfast with invitingly opened pages; they kept boredom at bay when the weather was bad. &nbsp;And sometimes you fell over them.</i></blockquote><br />In the meantime, here are some people who talk about the library who are waaaaay more eloquent than I am. <br /><br />Blog post from the ladies over at Rants from Mommyland:<br /><a href="http://www.rantsfrommommyland.com/2010/11/borrowing-from-libraryand-life.html">http://www.rantsfrommommyland.com/2010/11/borrowing-from-libraryand-life.html</a><br /><br /><br />Slam poetry from Taylor Mali: <br />(Really, you should spend the rest of your night watching/listening to his poetry)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/2qXgPfMGG8E/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/2qXgPfMGG8E&fs=1&source=uds" />   <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />   <embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/2qXgPfMGG8E&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/1rZzwIb6aPE/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1rZzwIb6aPE&fs=1&source=uds" />   <param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" />   <embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1rZzwIb6aPE&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
