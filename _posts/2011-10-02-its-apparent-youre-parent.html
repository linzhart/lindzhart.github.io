I put the boys to bed and am feeding the baby, hoping she will fall asleep.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Boy: "Mom there is a spider in our room."</div><div><br /></div><div>So I grab the closest hard thing, which happens to be a crayon box, and come to the rescue - trying to keep the baby reclined so that she will stay relaxed.  It takes a few tries before it stops trying to crawl away.  All the while my son is yelling "That's MY crayon box!"</div><div><br /></div><div>I go to the bathroom for tissue to pick up the spider and step in something wet and warm in front of the toilet.  Without blinking, I wipe my foot on a towel - also on the floor - as I walk past. </div><div><br /></div><div>I pick up the spider, my son says "Mom, put it in the toilet - but don't flush.  I want to pee on it next time."  </div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Fine" </div><div><br /></div><div>I dispose of the spider and sit down to rock the baby again. </div><div><br /></div><div>The other boy comes in: "Mom, I have to go to the bathroom, but JJ doesn't want me to flush.  Can I go and NOT flush so that we can both pee on the spider?"</div><div><br /></div><div></div><div>Me: "Fine."</div><div><br /></div><div>Him from the bathroom: "I think it's still alive!"</div><div><br /></div><div>Him, still from the bathroom: "Look! Another one!"</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Take care of it."</div><div><br /></div><div>Him: "Aaaaahhhh!  I think it bit me."</div><div><br /></div><div>Me, now in the bathroom with the baby on my hip. "Why did you try to pick it up with your hand?"  </div><div><br /></div><div>I grab some toilet paper and demonstrate the proper spider squishing/picking up technique and throw the spider in the toilet next to the other one.  His hand shows no sign of a bite so I tell him to put his pants on, because for some reason, they had to come all the way off in order to aim properly at the spider.</div><div><br /></div><div>He goes to bed and I sit down to rock the baby again.</div><div><br /></div><div>His brother comes back in: "Mom, my tummy really hurts.  I think I'm going to throw up."</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Go pee on the spider, that might make you feel better."</div><div><br /></div>
