I have five kids and I'm exhausted, I just haven't had the energy to deal with it. &nbsp;My only defense is that at least she isn't carrying it around the house all day, so it isn't delaying her speech; she is only allowed the binky in her bed. I should take it away, and I will. &nbsp;Just not tonight, tonight I want to sleep. <br /><br />Child 4 comes into the kitchen sucking on her binky.<br /><br />Me: "Binkies are for bed. &nbsp;Take it upstairs."<br /><br />Her: Popping the binky out of her mouth, "But it's MY binky."<br /><br />Me: "And it belongs in YOUR bed. &nbsp;Go put it away."<br /><br />Her: "But it's MINE."<br /><br />Me: "Yes, it's yours. &nbsp;Go put it in your bed."<br /><br />Her: "But Mommy, it's my <i>birthday</i>."<br /><br />Me: "No it isn't! Go."<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
