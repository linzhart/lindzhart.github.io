I've heard a lot of people say that some mental issues are only a fad. &nbsp;That things like ADHD and&nbsp;Autism&nbsp;aren't really as prevelant as statistics would have us believe. &nbsp;These people seem to think that if no-one had a name or a medicine for a disability then no-one would HAVE that disability; that people who raise awareness for a disorder are somehow causing the disorder. &nbsp;I find this facinating (and sad).<br /><br />It's true that as doctors get better at diagnosing we will see more people with certain labels. &nbsp;And maybe there are some doctors out there who misdiagnose out of ignorance or lazyness. &nbsp;I'm also sure there are some environmental factors to some of these "newer" disorders that we've yet to figure out. &nbsp;And now that we don't gather up people with dementia, down syndrome, depression, epilepsy and every other abnormality we can think of and label them "insane" and send them to an institution; naturally you are going to see an hear about these things more often.<br /><br />But there is one thing we don't talk about much in the context of people with disabilities or disorders, and that is that our society is changing so quickly and we only label and treat things that are a problem. &nbsp;If it doesn't&nbsp;interfere&nbsp;with what we think someone should be doing, then it isn't an illness. &nbsp;And our expectations have changed wildly over the past couple hundred years.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qmveWcVrHJ8/TzXzhSaguAI/AAAAAAAAAvg/zZJJbwYDMV8/s1600/darcy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qmveWcVrHJ8/TzXzhSaguAI/AAAAAAAAAvg/zZJJbwYDMV8/s200/darcy.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">They cut out the bottom of the frame<br />so you can't see his hands flapping.</td></tr></tbody></table>Which brings us to Mr. Darcy and his high-functioning&nbsp;Autism. &nbsp;I could write a whole thesis on this - let's just say if there was such a thing as a degree in psychology and literature you would have to call me Doctor.<br /><br />Everyone who meets Darcy at a party thinks he is rude because he doesn't initiate conversation and has little to say. &nbsp;His friends say he is a wonderful man, but takes some time to get to know. &nbsp;He admits how uncomfortable people make him, especially in large groups. &nbsp;It is because he is autistic and has a hard time reading social cues. &nbsp;He says how irritating he finds the music with so many people around - maybe a little bit of sensory processing disorder as well? &nbsp;His disorder makes it hard to easily converse with people, and they assume he looks down on them.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hKPvt339dZo/TzXzha7IWgI/AAAAAAAAAvY/cmA8-dSVFhQ/s1600/darcy+(1).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hKPvt339dZo/TzXzha7IWgI/AAAAAAAAAvY/cmA8-dSVFhQ/s200/darcy+(1).jpg" width="170" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Memorizing the number of rose <br />sconces&nbsp;in the&nbsp;mantelpiece.</td></tr></tbody></table>A man born in the time and station of Mr. Darcy had a good chance of being very successful despite his&nbsp;Autism. &nbsp;He would have had tutors and governesses giving him one-on-one instruction constantly. &nbsp;And at the time, social mores were much more rigid. &nbsp;There were rules about who talks to whom first, what to say and how to say it. &nbsp;Life would be much easier for those with Autism if they had a set of rules to memorize on how to interact with people on a daily basis. &nbsp;Our culture is changing so fast that there are almost no conventions for polite behavior anymore, and people are proud of their "openness" and "freedom" and think that anyone who tries to teach basic manners is a prude. &nbsp;Of <i>course </i>people who have a hard time reading social cues are standing out more - our society is not supporting them like it used to. &nbsp;So now we see him as a "problem" and he needs treatment, instead of every woman waiting with hearts a-flutter hoping he will notice her.<br /><br />Mostly what I'm saying is that there are probably lots more disorders out there that have yet to be named because they are not a problem right now. &nbsp;Maybe someday they will be. <br /><br />What actually got me thinking about this is the fact that you can have ADHD (Attention Deficit, Hyperactive Disorder) or ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) but why can't you have HD (Hyperactive Disorder)? &nbsp;Because what do we call someone who is hyperactive but can concentrate for long periods of time? &nbsp;Driven. &nbsp;Ambitious. &nbsp;Around here we call him John.<br /><br />I believe my dear husband was born without the ability to be still. &nbsp;He can sit, but he can't not think of 10 new ideas in five minutes. &nbsp;He loves to be busy, he needs it. &nbsp;To the point where he recently quit his comfy&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;job to do free-lance work because he didn't have enough to do. &nbsp;The job he only worked part time while he gets his PhD. &nbsp;And teaches. &nbsp;And does research. &nbsp;And&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;several hours a week at church. &nbsp;And makes sure his is available to help the kids with homework. And did I mention I've been sick, so he has taken over the dinner, laundry, lunch-making chores as well? &nbsp;Plus, he is really good in bed. &nbsp;I love the man dearly, but if you ever called him "normal" I'd have to laugh in your face. <br /><br />I guess I just wanted to say that none of us fit in a mold. &nbsp;We all have quirks. &nbsp;It all kind of depends on your perspective. &nbsp;Next time you see someone you might want to classify as weird - try picturing him in a puffy shirt and cravat; &nbsp;it may just be a Mr. Darcy.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ExbD69jdh20/TzXzhznhc5I/AAAAAAAAAvo/TB3UTKZRyyM/s1600/headshot.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ExbD69jdh20/TzXzhznhc5I/AAAAAAAAAvo/TB3UTKZRyyM/s400/headshot.jpg" width="360" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yFR4vYcp6gk/TzX1-t1kfPI/AAAAAAAAAvw/-urnrhSoY-4/s1600/ppz.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yFR4vYcp6gk/TzX1-t1kfPI/AAAAAAAAAvw/-urnrhSoY-4/s200/ppz.jpg" width="131" /></a></div>And I must add a plug for the book <u>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</u>. &nbsp;It is AWESOME. &nbsp;Not least for the fact that Darcy beats up Wickham - dude totally had it coming.
