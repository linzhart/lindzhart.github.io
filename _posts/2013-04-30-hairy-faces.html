<div style="text-align: center;">"When a man grows hair all over his face it is impossible to tell what he really looks like.</div><div style="text-align: center;">Perhaps that's why he does it. &nbsp;He'd rather you didn't know." - Roald Dahl</div><br />For the majority of our married life my husband has had a beard. I like it. It suits him.<br /><br />Every once in a while, he decides to shave it off. &nbsp;Usually in the summer, to remind us all what his chin looks like. And in 20 minutes he drops ten years. And I'm stuck looking every second of my thirty-some-odd years. So family pictures are definitely out. I know cougars are trendy now and all....but, no.<br /><br />It's hilarious to watch the children react to him. &nbsp;They tell him he looks like their Uncle Travis (his little brother) and that it's weird. &nbsp;The baby was not happy about him holding her until he started talking. &nbsp;Then she buried her face into his chest (at least he still smells like Daddy should). <br /><br />The two-year-old was the best, though. "It's OK, Daddy. &nbsp;You can buy some more face at the store."
