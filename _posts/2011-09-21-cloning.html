<div>It is always kind of freaky to hear my kids repeat my exact words and my exact tone of voice.  Do I really sound like that?  On the other hand, at least I know they are listening <i>sometimes </i>- even if it isn't always at my best moments.  </div><div><br /></div><div>It is especially startling to hear my daughter do it.  She just sounds so much like me.</div><div><br /></div><div>The kids were doing homework while I was making dinner.  Five-year-old asked for a drink, and then asked again and again when I didn't stop what I was doing to give it to him.  Lil' girl puts down her crayons, leans across the table to get right in his face and says: "Did you hear mommy?  She said just. a. minute.  You need to wait!"</div><div><br /></div><div>And then there was here endless jabbering to Daddy while he was putting on his shoes to go to work.  "Daddy. . . .Daddy. . . .DADDY!  I'm asking you a question!"</div><div><br /></div><div>She wanders around the house with her baby doll on her hip and toy phone stuck to her ear.  All I can think is:  "Oh look.  It's me."</div><div><br /></div><div>And then she comes up with some stuff completely out of nowhere. Flipping through the pages of a book while I change her sister's diaper. . . "Mommy, you know what butterflies have?  Know what kind of heads?  Eeeevil heads.  Butterflies have eeeevil heads.  And wings.  Butterflies have eeevil wings.  Eeevil heads and eeeevil wings."</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><br /><div><br /></div>
