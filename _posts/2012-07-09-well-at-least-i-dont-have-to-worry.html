Hanging out with my niece and my daughter at my mom's house the other day. . . .<br /><br />Niece: "Sometimes my curtains look like ghosts or monsters!"<br /><br />Me: "But nice monsters, right?  The ones that tickle you?"<br /><br />Niece: "Or ZOMBIES! They will eat your braaaaains!"<br /><br />Daughter: "Mom, you don't have brains. You just have hair."&nbsp; <br />(as if the two are somehow mutually exclusive)<br /><br />&nbsp;Later, as Husband was rocking the baby, I was telling him this story &nbsp;and that I should just go ahead and change the name of my blog to "Things my 3-year-old says." The baby grinned and <i>chuckled</i>.  <br /><br />A Lady, you-have-no-idea-what-is-in-store-for-you kind of chuckle. <br /><br /><a href="http://inconclusiveexperiences.blogspot.com/2011/09/clever-girl.html">I'm afraid of what she has in mind for me. </a>
