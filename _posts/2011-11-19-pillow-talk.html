Our day ended as it always does. &nbsp;Prayer, cuddle, kiss. . .<br /><br />Me: "I love you."<br />Him: "I love you, too. &nbsp;You should really go to sleep now."<br />Me: "Yeah. . . . I will."<br />Him: &nbsp;"You know the only good thing about you being sick? &nbsp;The only, ONLY good thing? &nbsp;YOU LISTEN."<br /><br />Him being him: "You should go to bed now."<br />Him being me: "Bed - schmead."<br /><br />Him being him: "You should eat some meat today."<br />Him being me: "<i>Your mom</i> eats meat."<br /><br />Me (trying to talk around the giggles): "Just what you always wanted. &nbsp;An obedient wife."<br />Him: "Yeah, right."<br /><br />See, I have this problem. &nbsp;The minute someone tells me to do something, I want to do just the&nbsp;opposite. &nbsp;It is so automatic, I usually can't even help it. &nbsp;This is one reason I enjoy religion. &nbsp;Obedience requires a&nbsp;discipline&nbsp;that does not come naturally to me, but I find joy in training myself to do what I <i>know </i>is right, even if someone else told me first. <br /><br />And for all you rabid-anti-man-feminists out there (as opposed to normal feminists) who are all thinking "How dare he tell you what to do? &nbsp;Don't you let a man control you!" &nbsp;I say: "Amen, sister! &nbsp;How dare h. . . . oh, wait." &nbsp;So remember a couple of months back when I went on this self-improvement kick and said things to him like, "I really think everyone would be happier if I were getting more sleep. . . but I have such a hard time remembering what time it is. . . could you remind me when it is time to go to bed?" and "Wow. &nbsp;I feel so good when I'm eating enough protein, but it just never occurs to me. &nbsp;Will you help me?"<br /><br />So yeah, even when I ask for help, I won't take it. &nbsp;Maybe there is a silver lining to me not having enough energy for my attitude.
