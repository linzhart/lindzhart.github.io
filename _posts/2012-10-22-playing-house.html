Since the boys started school and my oldest daughter is now the biggest (aka bossiest) kid at home, we have been playing "house" a lot lately. <br /><br />It is kind of awesome because I don't have to stop what I'm doing (I play house all day every day!) and I'm still playing with her. &nbsp;Child 3 is always the mom, and I am always the kid, sometimes the baby gets to play as the pet. &nbsp;She makes allowances because she is a "Small Mom" and I am a "Big Kid" so I can drive her to the grocery store or&nbsp;vacuum&nbsp; or do the baby lifting.<br /><br />It gets confusing when she plays house by herself though, because I'm usually only half listening and I answer her questions even when (clearly) she was talking to "Mom" the cat. &nbsp;She gets very annoyed at me and sighs most&nbsp;dramatically. &nbsp;Also, I have no outward clues as to when she has started playing house by herself. &nbsp;The other day she got very upset because I answered when her foot (the kid) was asking her other foot (the mom) if she could go out and play. &nbsp;"I wasn't talking to you! &nbsp;*sigh* Your talking hurts my head."<br /><br />And then there is this: We were at my mom's the other day and she wanted to play house. We didn't have an established role for my mom so. . . I'll let her tell it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-c11fb9f039dbaf78" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Dc11fb9f039dbaf78%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1492035443%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D373054C9C516FFD2040DF0F0CC187AA940547FF1.866B68EE8EDAFBEA447E4813C09D3FCCC78FE4CD%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dc11fb9f039dbaf78%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DdbVaXMCwXJZunQ8B1hvwtV36RCU&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Dc11fb9f039dbaf78%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1492035443%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D373054C9C516FFD2040DF0F0CC187AA940547FF1.866B68EE8EDAFBEA447E4813C09D3FCCC78FE4CD%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Dc11fb9f039dbaf78%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DdbVaXMCwXJZunQ8B1hvwtV36RCU&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><br /><br />She is awesome and adorable and possibly in need of psychiatric help.
