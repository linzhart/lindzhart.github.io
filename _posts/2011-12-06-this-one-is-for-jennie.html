<i>(So Jennie, remember how we were going to try and come hear your choir sing with the kids this Christmas? &nbsp;We might not bring all the children.)</i><br /><br />I turned on some Christmas music while cleaning up.<br /><br />My two-year-old in her best angry voice:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"I don't <i>like </i>the people! &nbsp;Those <i>people </i>who <i>sing </i>in their. . . happy clothes.<br />NO happy Christmas!&nbsp;I<i> don't like</i> the people who sing."</blockquote><br />
