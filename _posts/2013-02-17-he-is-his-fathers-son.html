A few weeks ago, one of the speakers in church was a young man, about 16-years-old. &nbsp;He gave a nice talk, and at the end he got a little choked up talking about how grateful he was for his mother. &nbsp;It was very sweet. <br /><br />I leaned over to my husband and whispered in his ear: "Our sons are never going to do this for me. I can already tell." <br /><br />They do love me, and they will continue to love me, but public declarations that are sweet and moving? &nbsp;I highly doubt it.<br /><br />Then this week my second son brought home a valentine he wrote for me as an assignment in school. &nbsp;It said:<br /><br />Dear Mom,<br /><br />I love you. &nbsp;I love that you look like a worm. &nbsp;I will bring you lots of dirty dirt to eat. &nbsp;I will flush you down the toilet and into the sewers. &nbsp;Happy Valentine's Day.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jBY-5VMBCx4/USGUjOz_1WI/AAAAAAAABFw/xG3cylb4N6k/s1600/IMG_1612.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jBY-5VMBCx4/USGUjOz_1WI/AAAAAAAABFw/xG3cylb4N6k/s320/IMG_1612.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br />I wouldn't trade him for the world.
