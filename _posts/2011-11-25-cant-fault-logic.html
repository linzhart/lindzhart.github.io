Lil' girl likes to review the rules. &nbsp;This conversation took place as I was getting her out of the bath.<br /><br />Her: "We do NOT hit. &nbsp;Hitting is NOT nice."<br /><br />Me: "That's right."<br /><br />Her: "And swords. &nbsp;Only other swords. &nbsp;Not people. &nbsp;Swords only hit other swords, NOT people."<br /><br />Me: "Yes."<br /><br />Her: &nbsp;"It's not nice to hit people with swords."<br /><br />Me: "Yes."<br /><br />Her: "But brothers, brothers we can. &nbsp;Brothers are not people."
