I find it hilarious. &nbsp;And I'm thinking that it would be a great family Halloween costume. &nbsp;The children could be cats - and they would be in heaven, and I could be in my pajamas - not that different from normal life, actually.<br /><br />Then I started thinking....What if I really AM crazy? &nbsp;What if I don't have any children, and I'm so far gone that my family and friends are just humoring me? &nbsp;What if you are just reading my blog because it is like watching a train wreck? &nbsp;This psycho lady keeps posting pictures of cats and referring to them as her children and you're torn between horror and fascination? <br /><br />No. Really. I'm seriously questioning my sanity here. It would explain <i>so </i>much. They NEVER listen or <br />come when I call; I may as well be talking to myself. The house has this lingering smell that I can't quite place, and it never feels entirely clean. And trying to get us all out to the car to go anywhere?.....Exactly like herding cats.<br /><br />You'd tell &nbsp;me right? Stage an intervention or something? Maybe you already have and I'm blocking it from my memory.<br /><br />Oh, well. It isn't so bad here. Maybe this reality is better than the one I left behind. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Wanna see an adorable picture I took today?</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VaogAPawzZ8/UYCIG5OKSBI/AAAAAAAABIg/QYUe7vT35zk/s1600/images+(3).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VaogAPawzZ8/UYCIG5OKSBI/AAAAAAAABIg/QYUe7vT35zk/s1600/images+(3).jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Awwww!
