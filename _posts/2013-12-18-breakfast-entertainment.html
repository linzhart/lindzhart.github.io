The children were plotting their takeover of the world this morning.<br /><br />They started with Maine. Then on to Canada. After that it was Mexico and Australia, and then as the crowning jewel - Equestria! (Where the My Little Ponies live, for those of you not up on your children's television)<br /><br />They sneaked into Equestria via a secret portal and cleverly disguised themselves as a band. Child #1 was the violin player - with his bow and arrows disguised as a violin. Child #3 was the guitarist, her guitar was secretly her shirt, and she could shoot fire. Child #2 was the piano player, but the piano was actually bombs.<br /><br />They choreographed the whole thing. My favorite moment was my oldest standing on top of the coffee table, pointing his bow at his brother "Ok! NOW! Old McDonald Had a Farm!" And Child #2 played Old McDonald had a farm, Child #3 played air guitar and then they started laughing evilly and the "battle" began.
