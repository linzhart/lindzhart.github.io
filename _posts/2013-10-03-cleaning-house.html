To my children:<br /><br />Mommy is genetically a clean-freak, but I'm trying very hard to overcome my obsession in order to make our home more happy, even if it is less clean. <br /><br />And since there are five of you, most of the time the mess is winning, I'm trying to come to peace with that. &nbsp;I tell myself - it isn't dirt, just clutter; and if it means that I didn't yell at anyone, the fact that there are leftover blanket forts and Legos all over the living room just means that we've had a good day.<br /><br />I like to think I'm striking the right balance and that our house is <i>mostly </i>clean <i>most </i>of the time.<br /><br />Screaming "It's the end of the world as we know it!" the entire time I vacuum is very demoralizing. &nbsp;Please stop.<br /><br />Love, Mommy<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-a8c2ef8abe7b99ca" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Da8c2ef8abe7b99ca%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1492035443%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D4D8D8244A98D5E0A9BC545F57887F8E6D75AD694.6E84D08ECBE18A444C574F07E3B7B4305D07D92C%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Da8c2ef8abe7b99ca%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DciHd7_nr8lMrkP9HyvsKsQqp0Hg&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Da8c2ef8abe7b99ca%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1492035443%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D4D8D8244A98D5E0A9BC545F57887F8E6D75AD694.6E84D08ECBE18A444C574F07E3B7B4305D07D92C%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Da8c2ef8abe7b99ca%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DciHd7_nr8lMrkP9HyvsKsQqp0Hg&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div>(our most epic fort so far)<br /><br />
