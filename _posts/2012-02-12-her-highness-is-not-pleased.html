It has been unseasonably warm, so we left the front door open for a little while the other day. &nbsp;Lil' Girl saw the sun streaming into the living room and got very upset.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RUu4ma7kuHY/TziV7zPG9XI/AAAAAAAAAwI/tfP32o_ZjiU/s1600/IMGP2671.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RUu4ma7kuHY/TziV7zPG9XI/AAAAAAAAAwI/tfP32o_ZjiU/s320/IMGP2671.JPG" width="320" /></a>Her: "Why is the door open?"<br />John: "Because it is a beautiful day outside."<br />Her: "Well, I HATE it. &nbsp;The clouds are not PINK. &nbsp;It is NOT a beautiful day!"<br /><br />And after the fourth trip to the bathroom when she was supposed to be sleeping.<br />Me: "Go to bed and stay there."<br />Her: *sigh* "Mom, don't worry about ME."<br />Me: "Stay in bed."<br />Her: (another long-suffering&nbsp;sigh) "Fine." <br /><br />And getting ready in the morning:<br />Me: "Come, lets comb your hair real quick and get it out of your face."<br />Her: "Mom. &nbsp;It's fine."<br />Me: &nbsp;"But it's in your face."<br />Her: "But I'm a princess. &nbsp;I can just wiggle it out." (and then she demonstrates the proper princess hair tossing&nbsp;technique)<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-73jFuoJ1rJ0/TziN1knawkI/AAAAAAAAAv4/-GeU2FyR10w/s1600/IMGP2737.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-73jFuoJ1rJ0/TziN1knawkI/AAAAAAAAAv4/-GeU2FyR10w/s400/IMGP2737.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />
