<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I don't have a favorite day of the week, but I&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;have a least-favorite. &nbsp;That would be Thursday. &nbsp;Hence the blog name (It is also a plug for&nbsp;<u>Hitchhiker's&nbsp;Guide to the Galaxy</u>, and anything else written by Douglas Adams.) &nbsp;Thursdays and I go way back. &nbsp;Growing up, Thursday was always the day I had piano lessons, or gym class or math tests. &nbsp;Recently, Thursday is the day my husband chooses to attend night class (or the university schedules them - whatever). &nbsp;I am always braced for a rough day on Thursday.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;This semester, Husband works from home on Thursdays during the day; which is awesome because sometimes I get to kiss him when he comes&nbsp;downstairs&nbsp;for lunch before he goes back to work on his thesis. &nbsp;But he still has a night class. &nbsp;Which means homework time, dinnertime and bedtime are all a solo act. &nbsp;Last week was especially eventful.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;There were bruises and tears. &nbsp;My oldest spent an hour sitting on his bed before he was willing to talk to me about fighting with his brother. &nbsp;The length of time was his idea - he got involved in a book and wanted to finish it. &nbsp;Then another hour not doing his homework at the kitchen table. &nbsp;And the boys had a food fight at the dinner table. &nbsp;A food fight, seriously!?! So they mopped the floor and cried some more. &nbsp;The girls were a little sick and just wanted to be held, but not while I was holding the other one. &nbsp;I told them I would turn out their light early, and that every minute they wasted was time they wouldn't be reading. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">"Good!" said my oldest. &nbsp;"I finished my book anyway. &nbsp;And besides Mom, the earlier WE go to bed the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;earlier YOU have to go to bed."</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Me: "That's the point."</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Him: "Well. . . then. &nbsp;I mean, the earlier we go to bed the LATER you have to go to bed."</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The highlight of my evening was this note from my son, when he finally decided to practice his spelling words. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MoPzU2tqHH4/T0r8HATN14I/AAAAAAAAAzY/mL6Z9jO0WpM/s1600/spelling+words.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="452" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MoPzU2tqHH4/T0r8HATN14I/AAAAAAAAAzY/mL6Z9jO0WpM/s640/spelling+words.jpeg" width="640" /></a></div>Correct is one of his words. &nbsp;I think the&nbsp;original&nbsp;plan was to make up a&nbsp;sentence&nbsp;about how mad he was at me for every word, but that took too long, so he finally quit and just wrote them. &nbsp;He brought it to me while his younger brother was practicing reading, so we complimented him on his handwriting and let JJ practice reading it out loud.<br /><br />It was crazy and hectic, but it actually turned out to be a great day. &nbsp;It was one of those moments as a parent that I got to enjoy the fact that my kids' drama is not my drama. &nbsp;I can laugh at them when they are being&nbsp;ridiculous. &nbsp;Just because they are angry does not mean that I have to be angry back, and I wasn't. &nbsp;<br /><br />Growing up I was always surprised at parents when they wanted to be friends with their kids. &nbsp;Parents who were actually hurt by their children saying things like "I hate you!" &nbsp;All kids hate their parents sometimes. &nbsp;And I felt sorry for my friends who felt like it was their job to make their parents happy. &nbsp;One friend told me that his earliest memory was sitting on the couch next to his mom, trying to get her to stop crying. &nbsp;That is way too heavy a burden to place on a child. &nbsp;They shouldn't have to be the ones emotionally taking care of their parents.<br /><br />I like that my kids can be open with me about their feelings without worrying about how I will react. &nbsp;I'm not going to cry or scream or hurt anything. &nbsp;It isn't their job to boost my self-esteem. &nbsp;And they are free to be themselves too. &nbsp;They know that I love them, and they know that nothing they ever do can change that. &nbsp;My love for them is not conditional on anything they do. &nbsp;It is something that exists inside ME. &nbsp;They can't change it, ever. &nbsp;And by their actions that night, I could tell that they believed that. <br /><br />In our church we talk a lot about <a href="http://www.lds.org/pages/provident-living?lang=eng">self-reliance</a>. &nbsp;Most people take this to mean food storage and saving money, but I think that emotional self-reliance is just as important, if not more so. &nbsp;It is&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;harder. <br /><br />So it was a good Thursday. &nbsp;A self affirming, I-am-on-the-right-track Thursday. <br /><br />But I won't be changing the name of my blog.
