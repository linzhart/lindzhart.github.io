My two-year-old walked into my room as I was getting dressed......<br /><br />"Mama, you naked?"<br /><br />"Yes, I'm naked."<br /><br />Wrinkled nose and disgusted look: "Ew" and then she walked away.<br /><br />I'm yelling after her: "Hey! This is not "ew" this is normal! And it's YOUR fault! This body created yours, you don't get to say "ew"!<br /><br />Of course, she was already down the stairs and ignoring me.<br /><br />Nothing like starting my day with a self-esteem boost.
