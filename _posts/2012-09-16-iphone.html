So, my camera and my phone were dying at about the same time and I decided I wanted an upgrade. &nbsp;Husband was very willing because I rarely get excited about anything tech-ie like he does (and it meant that he could upgrade as well). <br /><br />&nbsp;Enter my new iPhone. &nbsp;I love it. &nbsp;It is awesome for entertaining the kiddos at the Dr.'s office or the DMV, and much easier to hold and read while I feed the baby than a book or magazine. &nbsp;The best thing is, of course, the camera. &nbsp;Shutter speed is faster than my old "point and shoot" and it takes better pictures. &nbsp;Plus, I usually remember to take it with me when we go out. &nbsp;It is especially helpful for getting pictures of 4th Child who is now almost 2, freakishly adorable, and never holds still. &nbsp;So I get adorable pictures like this. . .<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nRnsI88BcPQ/UFaZKuPiVPI/AAAAAAAAA5E/qY9JK_dwmTg/s1600/IMG_0014.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nRnsI88BcPQ/UFaZKuPiVPI/AAAAAAAAA5E/qY9JK_dwmTg/s320/IMG_0014.JPG" width="239" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Escjv9E-Z2Y/UFaZLyJsOeI/AAAAAAAAA5M/0sDaHheM0_Q/s1600/IMG_0035.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Escjv9E-Z2Y/UFaZLyJsOeI/AAAAAAAAA5M/0sDaHheM0_Q/s320/IMG_0035.JPG" width="239" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;and this, and this. . . .&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WVSQifmRCsA/UFaZd1JaO7I/AAAAAAAAA5U/qNXq-3_CjCg/s1600/IMG_0201.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WVSQifmRCsA/UFaZd1JaO7I/AAAAAAAAA5U/qNXq-3_CjCg/s320/IMG_0201.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><br />So when I get into blogging regularly again, expect a few more pictures. &nbsp;(I'm trying, honestly).<br /><br />We share a phone plan with my mother-in-law, so she came over to pick up her phone (iPhones for everyone!) and with visiting and getting dinner on, it was a while before I could sit down and just fiddle around with my phone by myself. &nbsp;But finally, everyone was settled and eating and the baby was hungry. &nbsp;So I went into the quiet living room to nurse the baby and look at my new toy. &nbsp;First thing I looked at was the camera. &nbsp;<i>Hmmm...cool. &nbsp;What can I take a picture of? </i>&nbsp;I certianly don't want a picture of the messy living room. <i>&nbsp;But, hey! &nbsp;I have an adorable baby right there.</i> &nbsp;So I focus the camera on #5 and I'm about to snap the picture when I realize that I don't really want a picture of my breast either. <br /><br />I always used to roll my eyes when I heard old folks talking about how technology is destroying our morals, but now I'm thinking maybe they have a point. &nbsp;Five minutes alone with my new technology and the first thing I try to do is take an inappropriate picture. &nbsp;Coincidence?<br /><br /><br /><br />And then there is this. &nbsp;I was playing around with my camera again when #2 got out of bed to tell me he had hit his head. &nbsp;I snapped a picture, and this is what I got: <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YpVZqFjmw0o/UFadTneh-TI/AAAAAAAAA54/YETWDmDljYI/s1600/IMG_0149.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YpVZqFjmw0o/UFadTneh-TI/AAAAAAAAA54/YETWDmDljYI/s640/IMG_0149.JPG" width="478" /></a></div>I have no idea what happened, but I swear I haven't messed with it in photo shop at all. <br /><br />I love it even though it is creepy. &nbsp;It kind of makes me not want to turn my back. &nbsp;He looks like he may actually murder me in my bed. &nbsp;(I should let him try out for a part in Supernatural, they always have evil kids)
