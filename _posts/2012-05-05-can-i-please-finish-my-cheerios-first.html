Boy: "Mom, have you ever been to France?"<br />Me: "Nope."<br />Boy: "Well, my friend Sarah knows how they kiss there. &nbsp;Her mom has been to France."<br />Me: ". . . . um. . . . (must. keep. face. neutral.) . . . Oh, really? . . . . . . How do you know that?"<br /><br />Before 7:30am is WAY too early to have these kinds of conversations with a seven-year-old. &nbsp;Can I go back to bed now?
