My <i>extremely </i>shy three-year-old had a bad ear infection and we couldn't get in to her regular pediatrician. I was bracing myself for an awful trip, but the on-call doctor was fantastic.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vpRzTXhGasw/U7De-1BTl6I/AAAAAAAABRY/wAw5npAvVEQ/s1600/photo+1+(1).JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vpRzTXhGasw/U7De-1BTl6I/AAAAAAAABRY/wAw5npAvVEQ/s1600/photo+1+(1).JPG" height="240" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Matching princess aprons<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>He stayed out of her space and talked to her, and even drew her a flower on a tongue depressor. He managed to check her ears with no fuss at all and that was that.<br /><br />Two days later she was still carrying around the flower.

And it warmed the cockles of my cold feminist heart.
