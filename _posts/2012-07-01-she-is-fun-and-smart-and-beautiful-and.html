<div style="text-align: center;">She is fun and smart and beautiful and brave. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;">I love this girl so much. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;">But I gotta say, one reason that I love this picture is because her mouth is closed. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;">That doesn't happen all that often.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dTPaP1cBGDU/T_EMxhjmwTI/AAAAAAAAA4o/y7wVybiEe_Y/s1600/IMGP2915.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dTPaP1cBGDU/T_EMxhjmwTI/AAAAAAAAA4o/y7wVybiEe_Y/s400/IMGP2915.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br />If I were to try and document all of the funny things she says, I'd basically have to follow her around with a recorder. &nbsp;Here is a recent example:<br /><br />"That cup Mommy got out used to be mine when I was a little girl. &nbsp;Now it isn't mine anymore, because I grew up to be biiiiig. &nbsp;. . . But I still have a head." <br /><span style="background-color: white;">(Imagine dramatic hand gestures.)</span>
