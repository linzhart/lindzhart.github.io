The girls have been in bed for 20 minutes, but are still talking....<br /><br />Me: "Stop talking. It is time to sleep!"<br /><br />Child #4: "But Mom! I'm just trying to decide who I should marry!"<br /><br />Me: "I'm pretty sure that can wait. Stop talking so you and your sisters can sleep!"<br /><br />Child #4: "But Mom! It will only take a second!"<br /><br />Me: "Go to sleep!"<br /><br />I went back upstairs. I'm pretty sure she kept up the conversation (but in a whisper), until she made her decision. I'm too afraid to ask.<br /><br />* &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /><br />Overheard Child #4 and her father.....<br /><br />Child #4: "Dad, do you know why I am so sad?"<br />(bear in mind, she does not sound remotely sad. Only matter-of-fact)<br /><br />Him: "No, why?"<br /><br />Child #4: "Because no boys love me."<br /><br />Him: "I love you. Your brothers love you. Your grandpas....."<br /><br />Child #4: "No! Dad, no boys MY AGE are in love with me."<br /><br />Him: "Oh. Ok, then."<br /><br />If anyone has any tips on how to keep her from growing up so fast, I'd love to hear them.
