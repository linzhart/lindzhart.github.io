<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Some awesome,&nbsp;anonymous&nbsp;neighbor brought us this gingerbread house with a new train car and a little poem every night for the last week or so before Christmas. &nbsp;It was beautiful and professional-looking and fun.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bTPs3p_Uo3E/UOTv0-MwM8I/AAAAAAAABA0/u3A2ud9FEy8/s1600/IMG_1413.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lOO1H2GCMH0/UOTv2VcxcMI/AAAAAAAABA8/ncdGXIUT1AY/s1600/IMG_1414.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lOO1H2GCMH0/UOTv2VcxcMI/AAAAAAAABA8/ncdGXIUT1AY/s400/IMG_1414.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">The kiddos all got pajamas for Christmas eve. &nbsp;(I'm actually very&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;that the Batman pajamas I tried to get were back-ordered for the girls' sizes. &nbsp;I <i>guess </i>monkey ballerinas are OK too. &nbsp;But Batman would have been cooler.)&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j1y73BvO4-4/UOTv8T7HcjI/AAAAAAAABBc/_rk7nEWVJ2w/s1600/IMG_1441.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j1y73BvO4-4/UOTv8T7HcjI/AAAAAAAABBc/_rk7nEWVJ2w/s320/IMG_1441.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Child #1 got a very cool Hex-Bug (we have quite a collection now). &nbsp;This one moves in a very creepy-bug-like manner that sends Child #4 screaming from the room every time we turn it on. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A61VbkZ2-KU/UOTv95kwD4I/AAAAAAAABBk/SittwQiZ8ko/s1600/IMG_1449.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A61VbkZ2-KU/UOTv95kwD4I/AAAAAAAABBk/SittwQiZ8ko/s320/IMG_1449.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;">Also, every time my kids pretend to be an animal, that animal has some kind of claws. &nbsp;And they are always wishing they could grow their fingernails long enough to sharpen them into points. &nbsp;So I bought press-on nails and filed them into points and painted them black with red blood dripping off the ends and became the coolest mommy ever. &nbsp;For like half a day. &nbsp;Then the glue didn't work anymore and I've been un-sticking tiger claws from the bottom of socks for a week. &nbsp;Bonus: they didn't stay on long enough for anyone to actually get scratched. Win.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1N2Odoja1gs/UOTv_-bulWI/AAAAAAAABBs/weQSF2Yghbg/s1600/IMG_1454.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1N2Odoja1gs/UOTv_-bulWI/AAAAAAAABBs/weQSF2Yghbg/s320/IMG_1454.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">I have to admit, Christmas usually stresses me out. &nbsp;I get all caught up in trying to MAKE<b>&nbsp;</b>it fun for everyone that I'm depressed and angry and no-one is enjoying anything. &nbsp;I love that people have all these great Christmas traditions that they look forward to every year. &nbsp;But I've realized that I can't do that. &nbsp;I'm just not <i>that </i>mom. &nbsp;I decided that our most important Christmas tradition is that we have fun. &nbsp;If it isn't fun, we won't do it. &nbsp;And even things that could be fun, but won't be because I have a bad attitude we will avoid. &nbsp;So that has been my focus this year. &nbsp;And it was great. &nbsp;I didn't fuss about making sure our celebration was traditional or religious or like anyone else's. &nbsp; I have had more fun this Christmas than I have in a very long time. &nbsp;</div>
