(I bet you didn't realize that was a luxury did you?) &nbsp;And yet. . . This nice older woman blocking the toothpaste isle asked me if there was a sale on babies. . . you know, because I have so many. . . *sigh*</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I kind of felt like saying something about the THREE other children she didn't know about. &nbsp;I'm not 'showing' yet, (unless you are my little sister - who says I'm getting fat; however she is 18 and allowed to have a warped view of what skinny actually is.) Really? &nbsp;What is the nice answer to that? &nbsp;"Please move away from the toothpaste - there is a sale on that too, and you already know so much about me that you know how I am about SALES."</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">And now that school is out for winter break, I had to take all the children with me to the grocery store. &nbsp;I know it looks like a lot, because the baby prefers to be carried, so I usually have her in the sling, then one kid is in the &nbsp;front of the cart and the other two hold on to either side. &nbsp;They are (mostly) well behaved and not causing a lot of havoc, but we can't discreetly sneak past anyone in an isle either. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">. . . .And of course, an nice older couple stopped to admire Baby-Blue-Eyes and then looked at the rest of &nbsp;my&nbsp;entourage. &nbsp;"I just can't decide what you have more of, kids or groceries."</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I have more than four gallons of milk on the average grocery trip! &nbsp;Don't tell me it is that hard. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I'm just going to pretend that nice older people are really bad at math and being nice.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br />So I tried to find another graphic to go with this post - but the only pictures of kids in a grocery store that I could find had one or two kids - three at the most. &nbsp;The only pictures of people shopping with more than three kids were Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. &nbsp;Which is <i>totally </i>what I look like when I go out shopping with my kids, so I didn't want anyone to get confused.<br /><br />But I found this instead. &nbsp;Enjoy.</div><div style="text-align: left;">p.s. I love that the adds that pop up when you watch this commercial are tips for a happy marriage.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nojWJ6-XmeQ" width="560"></iframe></div>
