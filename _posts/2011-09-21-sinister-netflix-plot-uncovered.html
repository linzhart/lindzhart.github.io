I find it amusing that so many people are upset about Netflix raising their prices.  Guess what?  You don't <i>have </i>to pay them anything.  You could turn off your computer or TV and read a book, go for a walk, hey, maybe talk to those people who live in your house!  Did you know you're related?   Instant media gratification isn't a right, but apparently whining about how you have to pay a few bucks a month more is.  <br /><div><br /></div><div>But we have decided to stop getting the DVDs mailed to our house.  We don't watch them very quickly anyway.  Husband and I are not very careful about arranging our queue.  So when he has a minute, he puts five or six movies he wanted to see and then I put on a handful of my own.  What I find ironic is that we made this decision the day <i>after </i>watching the last in a string of his blow-things-up movies.  So we'll cancel our subscription before we get to watch <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>, <i>Cats</i>, and the six-hour-long BBC <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Can't be a coincidence.</div>
