Husband is playing with the baby while I regale him about our three-year-old's latest antics.<br /><br />Him, by way of explanation: "She's three."<br /><br />Then he looks into the baby's eyes. &nbsp;"You'll be three someday and you can cause all the same problems."<br /><br />Me: "Then we could have a new baby, too."<br /><br />Him: &nbsp;"THEN will we be done?"<br /><br />Me: &nbsp;"At least one more after this. &nbsp;<i>Then </i>I am willing to negotiate a . . . ceasefire. &nbsp;But you know my negotiations will all be: &nbsp;Just ONE more? &nbsp;Just ONE more! &nbsp;Look at those cheeks! . . . . OK, that isn't true. &nbsp;My negotiation techniques will involve a babysitter for the kids,&nbsp;lingerie, and a box of condoms - WAY downstairs in a cupboard in the basement."<br /><br />Him: "Whatever. &nbsp;By then they will have invented a pill for men. &nbsp;I can remember to take a pill everyday, unlike some people I know."<br /><br />
