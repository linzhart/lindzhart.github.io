So. &nbsp;We had ANOTHER incident involving small idle hands and scissors. &nbsp;This was while Husband was out of town for a couple of days. &nbsp;Lil' girl came to find me with a handful of curls and the explanation: &nbsp;"Mommy. I didn't mean to."<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gdmIWfCmD7c/UIC0Gh5gTaI/AAAAAAAAA6w/3ijE9UcMMEw/s1600/IMG_0268.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gdmIWfCmD7c/UIC0Gh5gTaI/AAAAAAAAA6w/3ijE9UcMMEw/s320/IMG_0268.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n3nTOMCG8cQ/UIC0H9q7OMI/AAAAAAAAA64/ghmJDbsbgAY/s1600/IMG_0274.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="149" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n3nTOMCG8cQ/UIC0H9q7OMI/AAAAAAAAA64/ghmJDbsbgAY/s200/IMG_0274.JPG" width="200" /></a><br /><br /><div><br /></div><div>I think I handled it pretty well all things considered. &nbsp;And what I mean by that is that I didn't let her see me cry. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UJk5JDnp1EU/UIC0JK-OaUI/AAAAAAAAA7A/re3oeojWsV4/s1600/IMG_0278.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UJk5JDnp1EU/UIC0JK-OaUI/AAAAAAAAA7A/re3oeojWsV4/s200/IMG_0278.JPG" width="149" /></a>It isn't too terrible. &nbsp;And by that I mean it was fixed by my friendly neighborhood stylist and you can't tell anymore. &nbsp;Her hair was so long, and she cut off the end of her ponytail. &nbsp;It could have been much worse.<br /><div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yKsxHkkEhpY/UIC0Kf3w_yI/AAAAAAAAA7I/pvddmThtbpU/s1600/IMG_0281.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yKsxHkkEhpY/UIC0Kf3w_yI/AAAAAAAAA7I/pvddmThtbpU/s200/IMG_0281.JPG" width="149" /></a><br /><br />And it was a bit of a shock for me. &nbsp;I didn't realize I had any ego invested in my child's appearance. &nbsp;I guess I do a little bit. &nbsp;Five inches of blonde curls! &nbsp;People pay <i>money </i>to get hair like hers. &nbsp;And I've never cut it before. &nbsp;This is the same hair she was born in! <br /><br />Mostly I was trying to figure out the right way to tell her that she had done something wrong, without making her feel like she is only cute because of her hair. <br /><br />You know what is wrong with short hair? &nbsp;NOTHING. &nbsp;You know what makes you cute? &nbsp;YOUR HAPPY SMILE. You know why we don't cut our own hair? &nbsp;Ummm....because we prefer to pay someone to do that. &nbsp;And so that it is all the same length. <br /><br />Brilliant child rightly pointed out that <i>my </i>hair is not all the same length, and that I cut my bangs myself. &nbsp;And I'm left saying lamely: "Just don't cut your hair, Ok? Just don't."<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now you should go listen to this. &nbsp;I'm afraid we may be having this conversation in a few years at our house, too.<br /><br /><br /><br /><script id="prx-p73865-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/73865/embed.js?size=small"></script><br /><div><br /></div></div></div>
