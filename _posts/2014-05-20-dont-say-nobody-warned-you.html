I was hoping to buy myself a few extra minutes in the bathroom the other day, so I got the girls a snack and put my nook on the floor outside the bathroom. That way, when they came looking for me, they would find my nook, they can turn it on and get to the games without any help. I thought I was being so clever.<br /><br />After a minute or two my three-year-old came up and started banging on the door, whimpering.<br /><br />"What's wrong? What do you need? You have to talk!" I yelled through the door.<br /><br />Finally she answered: "I'm peeing!"<br /><br />We do have another bathroom. But she chose to stand outside the door and pee on the carpet. And my nook.<br /><br />Kinda makes you want to OD on birth control, huh?
