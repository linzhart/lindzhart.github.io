Child 1 and child 3 love to play Pet Shop. &nbsp;They pretend to be animals and I pretend to buy them. &nbsp;The other day they were being cats (big surprise).<br /><br />Child 1: "Mom, this is a pet store. &nbsp;Can you come and buy us?"<br /><br />Me: "I'm right in the middle of making dinner, and I can't leave right now. &nbsp;Can you wait?"<br /><br />Child 1: "Can't you buy us online?"<br /><br />Me: "Absolutely. &nbsp;Click, click, click. &nbsp;Beep, beep. &nbsp;Gee, I can't wait until my new cats come in the mail!"<br /><br />And they delivered themselves to my kitchen door, unpacked themselves from their remote-control crates (laundry baskets) and moved into the living room. &nbsp;I got dinner made without having them underfoot and they still felt like I was playing with them.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XsQ0q_0y18g/USGZFnONkuI/AAAAAAAABGM/CZDV9AhlpLc/s1600/IMGP2919.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XsQ0q_0y18g/USGZFnONkuI/AAAAAAAABGM/CZDV9AhlpLc/s320/IMGP2919.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>Parenting WIN.
