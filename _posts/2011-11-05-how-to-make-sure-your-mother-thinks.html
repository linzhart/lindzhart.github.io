(For seven-year-olds)<br /><br />As you walk out the door in the morning, call over your shoulder, "Oh Mom!  There is a spider under the blue thing."<br /><br />For added effect make sure this is on a day when Mom has been sick and the house is extra messy.  Also, she will still be recovering and not able to actually clean the whole house.  <br /><br />Gaaaah!  Do you know how many "blue things" are in this house?  All day long I hardly dared move anything without a shoe in my hand.  And I never did find it.<br /><br />Thanks, son.<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vYJoF7nn1gA/TrX-gwos6FI/AAAAAAAAAqE/SjeHnKYSA6s/s1600/IMGP2547.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5671719144507893842" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vYJoF7nn1gA/TrX-gwos6FI/AAAAAAAAAqE/SjeHnKYSA6s/s400/IMGP2547.JPG" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 300px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 400px;" /></a>
