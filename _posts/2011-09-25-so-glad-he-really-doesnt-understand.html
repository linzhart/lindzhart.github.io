<div>Service and sacrifice for others is a concept I feel very strongly about teaching my children.  But it is also complicated, and I'm kind of at a loss about how to do it.  I want them to realize how lucky they are.  </div><div><br /></div><div>So I was really excited when our church announced a big project they are doing next month.  We will be collecting items and assembling welcome kits for battered women and children's shelters in the area. </div><div><br /></div><div> Details here: <a href="http://wellsserves.blogspot.com/">http://wellsserves.bl</a><a href="http://wellsserves.blogspot.com/">ogspot.com/</a>  Anyone is invited.  COME HELP!</div><div><br /></div><div>Especially needed are comfort items for the kids who have usually had to leave all their possessions behind.  I was thinking the kids could help me put some quilts together and gather toys and games.</div><div><br /></div><div>Especially if the quilts are made out of adorable fabric like this, </div><div><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-neyUHAYLHek/Tn_ytkolDGI/AAAAAAAAAnI/tP4Q1RqF3Jc/s200/fabriccars.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5656506521742543970" style="text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 176px; height: 200px; " /><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-baBOSnq0wHg/Tn_ytnFIOiI/AAAAAAAAAnQ/9z6Sp_H6hYk/s200/fabricspiderman.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5656506522399160866" style="text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 176px; height: 200px; " /><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q18RTxi0hVk/Tn_yt-LCHoI/AAAAAAAAAnY/pK4U-DPs7NA/s200/fabricfancynancy.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5656506528597941890" style="text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 176px; height: 200px; " /></div><div>they will really brighten someone's day AND be a little hard for my kids to give up.</div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, this means I have to explain to them why there are children in shelters who need our help.</div><div><br /></div><div> First let me say this: </div><div><i><blockquote>Dearest Husband, Thank you for being the best man I have ever known.  Thank you for being so kind and gentle that my children have no concept of being afraid in their own home.  That when they think of a bad guy, the only thing they can picture are cartoon characters.  I love you more than words can say.</blockquote></i></div><div><br /><div>This afternoon I had the following conversation with my five-year-old.</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Their homes weren't safe.  So they had to go away with their mommies really fast."  </div><div><br /></div><div>Him: "Why weren't they safe?"</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Sometimes there are bad people who want to hurt other people.  They had to get away."</div><div><br /></div><div>Him: "So they are hiding?"</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Yes."</div><div><br /></div><div>Him: "But when the bad guys leave they can go home."</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "No.  The bad guys are people they know.  People who won't go away."</div><div><br /></div><div>Him: "But the bad guys have to go home sometime."</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Sometimes the bad guy is the dad of the family.  And he isn't nice to the mom and kids.  And they can't go home."</div><div><br /></div><div>Him: "Like animals?  How the daddy tiger or bear would hurt the cubs?"</div><div><br /></div><div>Me: "Yes.  Exactly like animals."</div></div>
