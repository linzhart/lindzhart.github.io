Several years ago, as my dear husband and I were preparing for our impending&nbsp;nuptials&nbsp;I realized that we didn't have a song. &nbsp;So I went through my collection of CD's (remember those?) and found three or four songs that I thought reminded me of US. &nbsp;I tried to get my then-fiance to pick one with me. &nbsp;His response? "They are all so. . . cheesy." &nbsp;Honey, that is what romance IS.<br /><br />But we couldn't find one that fit, so we were married without "our song." &nbsp; And what do you know, apparently the sound track is not what makes a happy marriage. <br /><br />But here we are, coming up on nine years and now we have TWO songs. &nbsp;Both of which are awesome and perfect for us. <br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qDbAgPmqRw0" width="420"></iframe><br /><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZPNqub966Tw" width="420"></iframe><br /><br />
