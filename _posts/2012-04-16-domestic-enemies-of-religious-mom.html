Also, I should be planning ahead more, then I could make sure the children are all the gender I want.&nbsp; Who knew? </div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vDDTrcfSoYk/T4zhk28h5hI/AAAAAAAAA04/3S9LXyvM6oA/s1600/Childs-Prayer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vDDTrcfSoYk/T4zhk28h5hI/AAAAAAAAA04/3S9LXyvM6oA/s200/Childs-Prayer.jpg" width="160" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">"Please bless Mommy to <br />stop being such a baby."</td></tr></tbody></table><u>The volunteering</u> – I put in a lot of hours volunteering at church. We’re talking A LOT.&nbsp; And since it is church, I feel morally obligated.&nbsp; I mean, would I tell God, “No, I’m sorry.&nbsp; I can’t help with the clothing drive, there is a new episode of Castle up on Hulu?”&nbsp; OK, I might.&nbsp; But I would feel really guilty about it.&nbsp; I hope that my children are learning by my example about how important it is to help others.&nbsp; Also, they are learning that even mommies sometimes do things they don’t really want to do.&nbsp; And whine about it.&nbsp; We are all working on whining together (See?&nbsp; Added bonus of family togetherness!)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><u>The stereotypes</u> – No, I will not be voting for Mitt Romney, I’m not related to Donny Osmond and I am the only wife my husband will ever have (Unless I die an untimely death, in which case; “Go right ahead and date Honey, but know that I will haunt every one of your love interests until they are afraid to come within 20 feet of you.”)&nbsp; I understand that you saw an HBO special or watched a reality show.&nbsp; I saw this movie about Catholics and now I realize that all the priests are actually part of some secret society that killed Da Vinci.&nbsp; (Oh wait, that was fiction?&nbsp; Oh good, I’d hate to think Tom Hanks really has that awful haircut.)&nbsp; It is hard to get accurate information about any group of people and then assume you know the individuals, no matter what the source.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or you know what would be nice?&nbsp; You could ask me.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7OlVhzh6vh0/T4ziN943KeI/AAAAAAAAA1I/fuexueo6R3E/s1600/missionarieselders.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="130" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7OlVhzh6vh0/T4ziN943KeI/AAAAAAAAA1I/fuexueo6R3E/s200/missionarieselders.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">HI! Want to talk about&nbsp;extremely<br />personal things with complete strangers?</td></tr></tbody></table><u>That awkward conversation</u> – The truth is that I love my religion and I love to talk about it.&nbsp; I don’t mind people who are genuinely curious and want to ask me details.&nbsp; But I know that religion is a touchy subject, and I don’t want to put people off.&nbsp; So if I seem hesitant to answer questions, it isn’t that you’ve offended me.&nbsp; It’s that I’m trying to avoid the religious equivalent of getting out my old granny wallet and showing you the pictures of all my grandkids, when all you wanted to know was if I’m allowed to use birth control.&nbsp; (Answer:&nbsp; Yes, we just don’t use it very effectively.)</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CSx9Uf6Xy-Y/T4zjR0qC3jI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/brXULzsbFaE/s1600/hell.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CSx9Uf6Xy-Y/T4zjR0qC3jI/AAAAAAAAA1Q/brXULzsbFaE/s200/hell.jpg" width="200" /></a><u>Hell</u> – As in, I don’t think you are going there.&nbsp; Like most people&nbsp; I know, my main focus is on relationships; my relationship with God, my relationship with Husband, my relationship with my kids, my relationship with my friends.&nbsp; I do not lose any sleep worrying about your immortal soul.&nbsp; I don’t believe any of us has enough information to accurately judge a person’s grocery store purchases, let alone another person’s heart and intentions.&nbsp; That is way above my pay grade.&nbsp; If I invite you to church with me it is because I’ve found something that genuinely makes me happy and I’d like to share it with you.</div></div>
