<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/popculture/939f/"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_9exgV2WzvE/TsCKiKM7CiI/AAAAAAAAAqM/5xzDNmgzhZI/s1600/come_to_the_darkside.jpg" /></a></div>I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with parenting books. &nbsp;I love knowing about what is going on with my kids developmentally and getting ideas of different things to try. &nbsp;But I hate how preachy some of them get and how guilt inducing they can be. &nbsp;Sometimes I think the underlying message is: "Do everything exactly the way we say or your child will turn into a psychotic killer - or a pole dancer - or a democrat."<br /><br />And I've read a lot of those books. &nbsp;(I'll send you a list if you're interested in my lit. review.) But, there are a few things that no parenting&nbsp;manual&nbsp;covers. &nbsp;The underside of parenting, if you will. &nbsp;Having children is the most amazing, wonderful, rewarding thing I've ever done. &nbsp;I love my children more than words can express. &nbsp;And they bring me such joy. &nbsp;I love to just sit and watch them play - it is awesome. &nbsp;But they also really piss me off sometimes. <br /><br />I mean I sometimes get really, really angry. &nbsp;As a rule, I'm not an angry person. &nbsp;It is actually very difficult to make me angry enough to even say "piss off." &nbsp;But it happens. &nbsp;And it happens with my children more than anything else. <br /><br />The thing is, I'm so invested in them. &nbsp;It is hard to step back and not take their misbehavior personally - especially because sometimes they mean it personally. &nbsp;They are MY kids. &nbsp;They know exactly which buttons to push and when, they know every little pet peeve and how to just <i>nudge </i>it. &nbsp;<i>Hey look, Mommy's eye is twitching again!</i><br /><br />And even more&nbsp;obnoxious, they are <i>like </i>me. &nbsp;Those annoying habits I've been trying for years to hide, they flaunt. &nbsp;They are stubborn in the ways that I am stubborn, they react badly to the same things I react badly to. &nbsp;Partly genetic, partly learned, all difficult. <br /><br />And I wish that more "What to expect.. . " books covered this. &nbsp;Because it is okay.<br /><br />It is normal.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with feeling very angry with your children. &nbsp;It does not make you a bad person or a bad parent. &nbsp;You are not failing because you are feeling something negative. <br /><br />The trick with parenting - and life - is not how you feel. &nbsp;It is how you ACT on how you feel. &nbsp;Finding a way to release, control, respond to your feelings that is healthy. <br /><br />And it won't always work, and you will find that you have reacted to a situation in a way that makes it worse. &nbsp;What to do then? &nbsp;Well, I have a lot of experience with this, I&nbsp;apologize. &nbsp;I tell my children what I did wrong and why it was wrong and ask them to forgive me. &nbsp;It is hard for me to not do this in an underhanded way: "I'm sorry I yelled, but if you would just stop . . .!" <br /><br />As a parent, my job is to model responsible adult behavior. &nbsp;Responsible adults recognize their mistakes. &nbsp;They don't blame others or make excuses. &nbsp;And then they move on and try to do better. &nbsp;It will take them a long time to learn this. &nbsp;It is STILL taking me a long time to learn this. <br /><br />And that is okay too.
