Poor Snow White, she somehow lost the use of her legs, and has to ride in a wheel chair now. (The "Little People School Bus" is handicapped accessible.) &nbsp;The dwarfs were very considerate of her. <br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zjSEJzAYg9Q/UNfQkBUO6xI/AAAAAAAABAI/a_7X5SfUCsQ/s1600/snow+white+and+seven+dwarves.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; display: inline !important; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zjSEJzAYg9Q/UNfQkBUO6xI/AAAAAAAABAI/a_7X5SfUCsQ/s200/snow+white+and+seven+dwarves.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The next day the two Marys were nose to nose. &nbsp;Their argument went something like this:<br />"MY baby Jesus is more powerful than YOUR baby Jesus."<br />"No! MY baby Jesus could defeat YOUR baby Jesus!<br />"No! Mine is bigger!"<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rzsmaYMpUh8/UNfQkmA1ffI/AAAAAAAABAQ/Xh3rIx47Fp4/s1600/wise+man.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rzsmaYMpUh8/UNfQkmA1ffI/AAAAAAAABAQ/Xh3rIx47Fp4/s200/wise+man.jpg" width="200" /></a>And the Josephs started shoving each other:<br />"I get to protect Mary and Jesus!"<br />"No! I do!"<br /><br />And of course, the wise men all wanted to give the baby their presents first.<br /><br />Then one of the Marys learned how to fly, so she ferried everyone to whichever shelf they liked the best.<br /><br />They've reached a sort-of peace now. &nbsp;They manage to share the one un-broken stable without much fuss. &nbsp;I'm actually worried that Joseph may have developed a thing for the wrong Mary. They keep sneaking off together and I find them hidden around corners and under tables. <br /><br />Even the Holy Family becomes&nbsp;dysfunctional&nbsp;when you bring them into our house.
