The boys were trying on Grandma's reading glasses.<br /><br />Boy 1: "Go look in the mirror! You look so weird."<br /><br />Boy 2: "Really?"<br /><br />Boy 1: "Yes. You look like a nerd."<br /><br />Boy 2 goes to inspect himself in the bathroom and comes prancing back a moment later.<br /><br />Boy 2: "Hey, guess what? If I was naked I would be a <i>nude nerd</i>!"<br /><br />* &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp;* &nbsp; &nbsp;*<br /><br />I can't remember now what they were arguing about.....something to do with their snack.<br /><br />Boy 1: "I'm right."<br /><br />Boy 2: "No, I'm right."<br /><br />Boy 1: "No. I'm right, PERIOD."<br /><br />Boy 2: "Well..... I'm right, EXCLAMATION POINT!"<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, at least you can tell they are paying attention in school sometimes.
