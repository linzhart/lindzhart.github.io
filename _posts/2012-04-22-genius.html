Sometimes, <i>very </i>rarely, I have a moment of parenting genius. &nbsp;A moment when I do exactly the right thing and it works perfectly. &nbsp;It doesn't happen very often, so I have to document and share it. &nbsp;Last week I had one of those moments.<br /><br />I was helping my&nbsp;Kindergartner&nbsp;with his homework. &nbsp;He has a hard time remembering which way his b's and d's face. &nbsp;This is totally normal, and most teachers and tests don't even count it as a mistake until 1st or 2nd grade. &nbsp;But he was frustrated and didn't want to have to keep asking me which way a D goes. <br /><br />We've also been learning the&nbsp;alphabet&nbsp;in sign-language, mostly because I knew it&nbsp;growing&nbsp;up and thought my kids should too.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4bZRDP7fY0/T5TPaB3fX5I/AAAAAAAAA2A/_2HWU39PprQ/s1600/D+(1).GIF" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4bZRDP7fY0/T5TPaB3fX5I/AAAAAAAAA2A/_2HWU39PprQ/s400/D+(1).GIF" width="290" /></a></div><br />SO: &nbsp;If you can't remember which way a D goes and you are writing something, just look at your hand. &nbsp;Does your hand remember? &nbsp;(pointer finger pops up) I DO! I DO! And you are making a d with your hand. &nbsp;He thought it was hilarious and he hasn't had a problem with it since.<br /><br />p.s. If you have a lefty, just make sure you tell him that his writing hand only remembers the letter B - the letter it learned first - hands have a short memory like that. &nbsp;OR if you know sign language, (and know that the letter b is different) tell him his writing hand is too busy, and he should ask his other hand, which should be on the desk anyway, holding the paper still.
