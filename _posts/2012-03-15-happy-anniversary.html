Nine years ago today I married the most wonderful man I'd ever met, and he just keeps getting better. &nbsp;I love him more now than I ever have and I am constantly amazed by his strength, his intelligence, and (yes) his wit. &nbsp;This has been - far and away - the best decade of my life. &nbsp;We now have four and a half adorable children. &nbsp;Our life together is awesome.<br /><br />We aren't doing anything special today. &nbsp;Partly because I am so sick I can't stand up for more than five minutes, but also because it is Thursday, and mid-week celebrations don't work very well for us. &nbsp;So I didn't throw off any plans by contracting the plague (which is what it feels like I have).<br /><br />We do have plans though. &nbsp;Big plans. &nbsp;Every year on our anniversary we celebrate our "Family Birthday." &nbsp;This is the day our family was born. &nbsp;We all go to the toy store and pick out our own present (within reason) then we come home and wrap them. &nbsp;Everyone gets to pick their favorite dinner, so I usually make three or four things, and we have cake and ice cream and sing "Happy Birthday to Us," open presents and generally enjoy hanging out together and being a family.<br /><br />That will be our Saturday celebration. &nbsp;I think I will try and steer everyone toward outside toys so that we can soak up as much spring sunshine as possible. &nbsp;And I'm hoping I'll be well enough to enjoy it. <br /><br />It is a fun tradition, and a nice way to spend time with our kids, but I'm hoping the deeper message will sink in as well. &nbsp;That marriage is important. &nbsp;That a family is created long before the children arrive. &nbsp;That while our children are an important part of our family, they didn't build it and they can't break it. <br /><br />I know it isn't&nbsp;trendy&nbsp;or popular right now to say that a traditional family is the best way to go. &nbsp;It&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;isn't the ONLY way, and it doesn't make other families bad. &nbsp; But there isn't a child in the world who doesn't wish to be born to parents who dearly awaited him and who love each other and who will be together forever. &nbsp;That is the ideal. &nbsp;Lots of times we fall short. &nbsp;Life, sickness, war, things get in the way of that. &nbsp;And we get up and move on and pick up the pieces as best we can. &nbsp;But it is still important to remember (and teach) that there is a right way and we are all reaching for that.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hoHuuIoNe6g/T2KjWMEU3kI/AAAAAAAAAz4/GJlSeSNpEsg/s1600/couple+scrapbook.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hoHuuIoNe6g/T2KjWMEU3kI/AAAAAAAAAz4/GJlSeSNpEsg/s640/couple+scrapbook.jpeg" width="484" /></a></div>And here is a page from our scrapbook. (Which I was really good at when I only had two children) The pictures are in chronological order, starting with before we were married to about four years ago. &nbsp;Which is why I find this comic so hilarious.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_32482917">xkcd: Fall Foliage</a></b></div><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_32482917"><br /></a><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><a href="http://www.blogger.com/goog_32482917"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GE6p-AA-dBU/T2KkiynnZFI/AAAAAAAAA0A/fIOpshYtc3I/s320/fall_foliage.png" width="320" /></a></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://xkcd.com/648/">(And I could replace you with older pictures of you, from back when you looked happy)</a></div>
