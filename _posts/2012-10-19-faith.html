About a year ago I was stuck. &nbsp;I was frustrated. &nbsp;I felt like I wasn't learning anything new. &nbsp;I was loosing patience with my kids all the time and feeling awful about it with no real way to stop myself. <br /><br />So I prayed a lot. &nbsp;I prayed for patience. &nbsp;I prayed for grace. I didn't know what to pray for, so I prayed for whatever it was I needed, trusting that God knew what that was. &nbsp;I knew God would help, after all, it is in His plan that these kids have a good mother, and (even though I don't understand how it is possible) He loves them even more than I do. <br /><br />And then I got pregnant. &nbsp;Because God is&nbsp;hilARious&nbsp;that way. &nbsp;We joked that if it was a girl we should name her Patience, since that is what I was praying for. &nbsp;But I knew someday I would loose it at her and people would look at me funny for yelling "Patience! Stop it!" <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yepa5QBZoi4/UIIoPjScfRI/AAAAAAAAA88/VRQ52KzD_9s/s1600/IMG_0874.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="149" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yepa5QBZoi4/UIIoPjScfRI/AAAAAAAAA88/VRQ52KzD_9s/s200/IMG_0874.JPG" width="200" /></a></div>So we named her Sophia, which means wisdom. &nbsp;I don't know that I feel any wiser; but I do feel calmer, more focused. &nbsp;And our house is much more peaceful, even if it is at the same time much more chaotic.<br /><br />A friend told me the other day, "I don't think I've ever seen you happier than when you have a baby in your arms." &nbsp;And I think she is right. &nbsp;We already know that I am a baby person. &nbsp;And it has been fun, because the new one looks a lot like my oldest when he was a baby, but I feel so much more confident in my abilities as a mother now. &nbsp;(I feel less confident about parenting an 8 year old. . . poor oldest child, just has to train the parents.)<br /><br />It takes at least six weeks before any baby can really hold eye contact, or begin to respond with smiles to his/her caregivers, and a few weeks longer than that before the first giggle. &nbsp;The first time I got to really sit with Phi and tickle her and get her to laugh was only a couple of months ago. &nbsp;It was magic.<br /><br />I was laughing and she was laughing, and we were in our own little bubble of perfect bliss. &nbsp;In that moment, I realized it didn't matter that I had been puking and exhausted and ugly for months. &nbsp;I didn't care about the pain of childbirth or the messy house or the stress of trying to keep everyone happy. &nbsp;It was all worth it. &nbsp;Anything I could have gone through in the previous year was worth those five beautiful minutes. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cmYmSLAhsBI/UIIoXWvpviI/AAAAAAAAA9E/FLqovq-N59w/s1600/IMG_0875.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cmYmSLAhsBI/UIIoXWvpviI/AAAAAAAAA9E/FLqovq-N59w/s200/IMG_0875.JPG" width="200" /></a></div>And still, in the evenings when everything is quiet and I have a few moments to kiss that chubby little neck, everything is Ok. &nbsp;Everything. &nbsp;I would do it all again and then some to have those cheeks to kiss, that smile, those eyes.<br /><br />And so this is my Faith. &nbsp;It may be simple, and silly, but this is what I believe: &nbsp;Jesus is better than baby cheeks. <br /><br />When all is over and we get to see our Heavenly Father and Jesus again we will be filled with such joy! &nbsp;It won't matter that life was awful and people were mean. &nbsp;We won't care what it took to get us to that moment, because it will be perfect. &nbsp;We will even think it was worth it, all that it took to get us there. &nbsp;And Heaven is the place where that feeling goes on and on. &nbsp;Where broken hearts are mended and and "the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ."<br /><br />Sometimes I get so discouraged. &nbsp;Our world is so full of hate and suffering. &nbsp;I don't believe that this pleases God, and I don't believe that He causes it. &nbsp;But I do believe He can fix it. &nbsp;It is possible to heal even the most shattered of lives, the most broken of hearts. &nbsp;Heaven is better than baby cheeks.<br /><br />And EVERYONE will get a chance to be there if that is what they want. &nbsp;I know, who wouldn't want to go to heaven, right? &nbsp;But I believe Heaven is a place full of people who are genuinely kind and want to serve others. &nbsp;Not everyone wants to put forth that effort. &nbsp;And being damned isn't all pain and fire and brimstone. &nbsp;Being damned is simply being stopped in your progress, like a river is damned. &nbsp;Not improving and going forward anymore. &nbsp;God won't force anyone to move forward if they don't want to. &nbsp;He will simply let them be. &nbsp;But they will have to <i>be </i>without the baby cheeks.<br /><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-f63fd3be96aa316d" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Df63fd3be96aa316d%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1492035443%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D8FAAFC161E56528CEE430D6B5FD8F17A4ACCD3D.A3993B695EE65D466BB97D9C1567A066ED787E59%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Df63fd3be96aa316d%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DmxJgsCX8sXbhdbWu78SEcsVDNOY&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3Df63fd3be96aa316d%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1492035443%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D8FAAFC161E56528CEE430D6B5FD8F17A4ACCD3D.A3993B695EE65D466BB97D9C1567A066ED787E59%26key%3Dck2&iurl=http://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3Df63fd3be96aa316d%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DmxJgsCX8sXbhdbWu78SEcsVDNOY&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span><span style="text-align: center;">Incidentally, the last time I prayed this hard for help and left the details up to God, I got unexpectedly pregnant and had a miscarriage. &nbsp;See, it isn't really about the babies. &nbsp;It is about whatever experiences we need at any given time. &nbsp;</span>
