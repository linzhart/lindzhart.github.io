I love listening to my kids talk. &nbsp;It is like getting tiny glimpses into how they think, and I love how they think. <br /><br />It is so cute how they can be so logical and still wrong. &nbsp;And I'm sure Heavenly Father thinks this about me all. the. time.<br /><br />A few quotes from my sweet two-year-old:<br /><br />As she is helping me do the dishes<br />Her: "What is this?"<br />Me: "Its a cup."<br />Her: "What is this?"<br />Me: "Its a baby spoon."<br />Her: "A baby spoon? &nbsp;Oh! Its SOOOO cute! &nbsp;What's it's name?"<br />Me: "Its a spoon. &nbsp;It doesn't have a name."<br />Her: "Yes it does. &nbsp;See?"<br />Turns out the spoon did have words on it, so it does have a name. <br /><br />After I tried on a new dress and then changed back into my regular clothes<br />Her: "Mom! Where is your beautiful dress?"<br />Me: "I took it off."<br />Her: "But you are supposed to WEAR it!"<br />Me: "Why?"<br />Her: "Because its MONDAY!" (The"duh" was implied.)<br /><br />Pretending to cook<br />Her: "I am making dinner. . . . it is called, <i>yucky food.</i> . . .Want a bite?"<br /><br />I'm pretty certain that our house is going to sound just like this in a few years. &nbsp;(minus the&nbsp;British&nbsp;accents)<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Al3CCSEl-fM" width="420"></iframe>
