I've never really wanted to <i>be </i>someone else, as in take over their life and all that, but there are all kinds of people that I wish I was like.<br /><br />Right now I'm wishing I was one of those women who waits until the last possible moment to announce that she is pregnant and then comes up with a creative, cute way to make the announcement.  <br /><br />But I'm not her.  I am pregnant, though.  Only a couple of months along, but the weeks and weeks of vomiting are kind of a dead giveaway. There are a couple of days in there where I don't even know what happened.  I know that I managed to crawl downstairs while John got the boys ready for school. &nbsp;The girls are still alive, so they must have found something to eat. . . judging by the crumbs on the floor, I'd guess crackers.<br /><br />Fortunately, I have a wonderful mother, mother-in-law and sisters and neighbors and I'm hoping that we're over the worst. &nbsp;At least, I'm keeping most of my food down most of the time and I'm usually functional for most of the day. &nbsp;Progress.<br /><br />It is frustrating though, because I come from a long line of hearty, pioneer women who could plough a field, make soap, have a baby, make new shirts for the other 13 children, and then spend the rest of the day making dinner for neighbors, writing poetry and washing the laundry by hand. &nbsp;Obviously the apple has fallen FAR from the tree. <br /><br />And the "morning" sickness is so unpredictable. &nbsp;I feel like I've become a worshiper in some ancient cult - trying to control&nbsp;volcanoes&nbsp;and monsoons by sacrifices and rituals. &nbsp;I had five bites of un-sweetened cereal and then took my medicine - I lay down for twenty minutes and then ate some applesauce - I did the rain dance around the fire on the fifth day after the full moon - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. &nbsp;But I still cling to my systems and imagine that I can refine them until I get it just right. &nbsp;Otherwise I would have to admit that I have absolutely no control &nbsp;and my world will be&nbsp;devastated&nbsp;or not no matter what I try to do.<br /><br />During the hours that I feel good, I'm really excited. &nbsp;We were planning a longer gap between the last baby and the next one (19 months apart!) but I love babies all the time and am looking forward to another of my husband's beautiful <strike>spawn</strike>&nbsp;offspring. &nbsp;Plus, I can't wait to meet this little person. &nbsp;Anyone so determined to join our family that they make it through two forms of birth control is going to be an adventure. <br /><br />(I tell my husband that he has Chuck Norris sperm - you can't kill it, you can't stop it. &nbsp;He says I have electro-magnetic eggs that suck everything in. &nbsp;So we both like to blame each other. &nbsp;But we both know, it takes two to tango.)
