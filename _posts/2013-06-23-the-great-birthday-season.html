<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Scene: My oldest is turning 1 - he is the first grandchild on both sides of the family and we are having a party. Immediate family only, so that makes 15 -20 people to cram into our small apartment. &nbsp;I insisted on making a cake and cleaning the house - not particularly unreasonable, but in practice nearly impossible. See, I don't know it yet, but I am pregnant with #2 and the hormones have given me a split personality - and not a nice cute one either, think "Hulk SMASH!" Husband still shudders when we bring up that day.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">I think I gave him PTSD.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">I kept trying for a couple more years, but eventually I just gave up on birthdays. &nbsp;It isn't worth the stress it causes me. And my kids really only care about the presents anyway. If you are the mom who decorates and invites the whole class over and bakes the cake herself and hand-makes all the party favors... well, I'm quite sure good mother-hood is not measured by the pictures on your pinterest board, and I won't waste my time comparing myself to you or feeling bad that I don't measure up. If that kind of thing makes you happy, awesome. &nbsp;Our celebrations are much more low key. &nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">By the way, I do kind of worry about birthday party etiquette. If my kid gets invited to your kid's birthday party will you feel bad if your kid doesn't get a return invitation? My boys seem to have gotten fewer birthday invitations this year than they did last year, and I'm not sure if it is because parents have wised up and stopped torturing themselves at all, or if they just quit inviting my kids because we didn't reciprocate. It doesn't change anything. &nbsp;There is still NO WAY I am throwing a birthday party for my kids. But at least I would know which parents I should apologize to.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">Husband, and children 2,3 and 5 all have birthdays within a three week period. So here are some pictures:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2ETxIed2Z_4/Ub6KE4A8QPI/AAAAAAAABJM/2CiemgIa_qY/s1600/IMG_2246.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

text-align: center;">The four-year-old got princess pjs, a tiara and shoes. &nbsp;Here she is dancing with her little sis.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lbx_a1htwKc/Uce8nmKcdKI/AAAAAAAABKc/Gj1LijCIop4/s1600/IMG_2366.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Lbx_a1htwKc/Uce8nmKcdKI/AAAAAAAABKc/Gj1LijCIop4/s320/IMG_2366.JPG" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;This made him very happy.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Exactly what he wanted. He was SO excited.<br /><br />I didn't even get a picture of Husband's birthday. Which involved date night and me NOT telling the waitress that it was his birthday. &nbsp;And a marvelous time was had by all.<br /><br />The end (for a couple of months)
